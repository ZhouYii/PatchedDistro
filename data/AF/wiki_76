Great Sioux War of 1876

The Great Sioux War of 1876, also known as the Black Hills War, was a series of battles and negotiations which occurred between 1876 and 1877 involving the Lakota Sioux and Northern Cheyenne against the United States. As gold was discovered in the Black Hills, settlers began to encroach onto Indian lands, while pressure was mounted by the federal government for the Indians to remain on the Sioux reservation. Traditionally, the United States military and historians place the Lakota at the center of the story, especially given their numbers, but some American Indians believe the Cheyenne were the primary target of the US campaign. An alternative interpretation suggests that the Indians would have called it "The Great Cheyenne War".
Among the many battles and skirmishes of the war was the Battle of the Little Bighorn, often known as Custer's Last Stand, the most storied of the many encounters between the U.S. army and mounted Plains Indians. That Indian victory notwithstanding, the U.S. with its superior resources was soon able to force the Indians to surrender, primarily by attacking and destroying their encampments and property. The Great Sioux War took place under the Presidencies of Ulysses S. Grant and Rutherford B. Hayes.
Background.
The Cheyenne had migrated west to the Black Hills and Powder River Country before the Lakota and introduced them to horse culture about 1730. By the late 18th century, the growing Lakota tribe had begun expanding its territory west of the Missouri River. They pushed out the Kiowa and formed alliances with the Cheyenne and Arapaho to gain control of the rich buffalo hunting grounds of the northern Great Plains. The Black Hills, located in present-day western South Dakota, became an important source to the Lakota for lodge poles, plant resources and small game. They were considered sacred to the Lakota culture. 
By the early 19th century, the Northern Cheyenne became the first to wage tribal-level warfare. Because European Americans used many different names for the Cheyenne, the military may not have realized their unity. The US Army destroyed seven Cheyenne camps before 1876 and three more that year, more than any other tribes suffered in this period. From 1860 on, the Cheyenne were a major force in warfare on the Plains. "No other group on the plains achieved such centralized tribal organization and authority."
The Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868, signed with the US by Lakota and Northern Cheyenne leaders following Red Cloud's War, set aside a portion of the Lakota territory as the Great Sioux Reservation. This comprised the western one-half of South Dakota, including the Black Hills region for their exclusive use. It also provided for a large "unceded territory" in Wyoming and Montana, the Powder River Country, as Cheyenne and Lakota hunting grounds. On both the reservation and the unceded territory, white men were forbidden to trespass, except for officials of the U.S. government.
The growing number of miners and settlers encroaching in the Dakota Territory, however, rapidly nullified the protections. The US government could not keep settlers out. By 1872, territorial officials were considering harvesting the rich timber resources of the Black Hills, to be floated down the Cheyenne River to the Missouri, where new plains settlements needed lumber. The geographic uplift area suggested the potential for mineral resources. When a commission approached the Red Cloud Agency about the possibility of the Lakota's signing away the Black Hills, Colonel John E. Smith noted that this was "the only portion their reservation worth anything to them". He concluded that "nothing short of their annihilation will get it from them".
In 1874, the government dispatched the Custer Expedition to examine the Black Hills. The Lakota were alarmed at his expedition. Before Custer's column had returned to Fort Abraham Lincoln, news of their discovery of gold was telegraphed nationally. The presence of valuable mineral resources was confirmed the following year by the Newton-Jenney Geological Expedition. Prospectors, motivated by the economic panic of 1873, began to trickle into the Black Hills in violation of the Fort Laramie Treaty. This trickle turned into a flood as thousands of miners invaded the Hills before the gold rush was over. Organized groups came from states as far away as New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia.
Initially, the United States Army struggled to keep miners out of the region. In December 1874, for example, a group of miners led by John Gordon from Sioux City, Iowa, managed to evade Army patrols and reached the Black Hills, but the Army ejected them three months later. Such evictions, however, increased political pressure on the Grant Administration to secure the Black Hills from the Lakota.
In May 1875, Sioux delegations headed by Spotted Tail, Red Cloud, and Lone Horn traveled to Washington, D.C. in an eleventh-hour attempt to persuade President Ulysses S. Grant to honor existing treaties and stem the flow of miners into their territories. They met with Grant, Secretary of the Interior Columbus Delano, and Commissioner of Indian Affairs Edward Smith. The US leaders said that the Congress wanted to pay the tribes $25,000 for the land and have them relocate to Indian Territory (in present-day Oklahoma). The delegates refused to sign a new treaty with these stipulations. Spotted Tail said, "You speak of another country, but it is not my country; it does not concern me, and I want nothing to do with it. I was not born there ... If it is such a good country, you ought to send the white men now in our country there and let us alone." Although the chiefs were unsuccessful in finding a peaceful solution, they did not join Crazy Horse and Sitting Bull in the warfare that followed.
That fall, a US commission was sent to each of the Indian agencies to hold councils with the Lakota. They hoped to gain the people's approval and thereby bring pressure on the Lakota leaders to sign a new treaty. The government's attempt to secure the Black Hills failed. While the Black Hills were at the center of the growing crisis, Lakota resentment was growing over expanding US interests in other portions of Lakota territory. For instance, the government proposed that the route of the Northern Pacific Railroad would cross through the last of the great buffalo hunting grounds. In addition, the US Army had carried out several devastating attacks on Cheyenne camps before 1876.
Combatants.
The number of Indian combatants in the war is disputed with estimates ranging from 900 up to 4,000 warriors.
The seven bands of the Lakota Sioux in the 1870s numbered perhaps 15,000 men, women, and children, but most of them were living on the Great Sioux Reservation and were noncombatants. An Indian agent in November 1875 said the Indians living in the unceded areas numbered "a few hundred warriors." General Crook estimated that he might face up to 2,000 warriors. Most of the Sioux who remained in the unceded territory where the war would take place were Oglala and Hunkpapa, numbering about 5,500 in total. Added to this were about 1,500 Northern Cheyenne and Arapaho for a total hostile Indian population of about 7,000, which might include as many as 2,000 warriors. The number of warriors participating in the Battle of the Little Bighorn is estimated at between 900 and 2,000.
The Indians had advantages in mobility and knowledge of the country, but all Indians were part-time warriors. In spring, they were partially immobilized by the weakness of their horses which had survived the long winter on limited forage. Much of summer and fall they spent hunting buffalo to feed their families. About one half of the Indian warriors were armed with guns, ranging from repeating rifles to antiquated muskets, and one half with bows and arrows. The short, stout Indian bow was designed to be used from horseback and was deadly at short range, but nearly worthless against a distant or well-fortified enemy. Ammunition was in short supply. Indian warriors had traditionally fought for individual prestige, rather than strategic objectives, although Crazy Horse seems to have instilled in the Sioux some sense of collective endeavor. The Cheyenne were the most centralized and best organized of the Plains Indians. The Sioux and Cheyenne were also at war with their long-time enemies, the Crow and Shoshoni, which drained off many of their resources.
To combat the Sioux the U.S. army had a string of forts ringing the Great Sioux Reservation and unceded territory. The largest force arrayed against the Indians at one time was in summer 1876 and consisted of 2,500 soldiers deployed in the unceded territory and accompanied by hundreds of Indian scouts and civilians. Many of the soldiers were recent immigrants and inexperienced on the frontier and in Indian warfare. Cavalry soldiers were armed with .45 caliber, single-action revolvers and the Springfield Model 1873, a single-shot, breech-loading rifle which gave the soldiers a large advantage in range over most Indian weapons.
Launching the war.
Grant and his administration began to consider alternatives to the failed diplomatic venture. In early November 1875, Major General Philip Sheridan, commander of the Division of the Missouri, and Brigadier General George Crook, commander of the Department of the Platte, were called to Washington, D.C. to meet with Grant and several members of his cabinet to discuss the Black Hills issue. They agreed that the Army should stop evicting trespassers from the reservation, thus opening the way for the Black Hills Gold Rush. In addition, they discussed initiating military action against the bands of Lakota and Northern Cheyenne who had refused to come to the Indian agencies for council. Indian Inspector Erwin C. Watkins supported this option. "The true policy in my judgement," he wrote, "is to send troops against them in the winter, the sooner the better, and whip them into subjection." 
Concerned about launching a war against the Lakota without provocation, the government instructed Indian agents in the region to notify all Lakota and Sioux to return to the reservation by January 31, 1876, or face potential military action. The US agent at Standing Rock Agency expressed concern that this was insufficient time for the Lakota to respond, as deep winter restricted travel. His request to extend the deadline was denied. General Sheridan considered the notification exercise a waste of time. "The matter of notifying the Indians to come in is perhaps well to put on paper," he commented, "but it will in all probability be regarded as a good joke by the Indians."
Meanwhile in the council lodges of the non-treaty bands, Lakota leaders seriously discussed the notification for return. Short Bull, a member of the Soreback Band of the Oglala, later recalled that many of the bands had gathered on the Tongue River. "About one hundred men went out from the agency to coax the hostiles to come in under pretense that the trouble about the Black Hills was to be settled," he said. "...All the hostiles agreed that since it was late the season and they had to shoot for "tipis" hunt buffalo they would come in to the agency the following spring."
As the deadline of January 31 passed, the new Commissioner of Indian Affairs, John Q. Smith, wrote that "without the receipt of any news of Sitting Bull's submission, I see no reason why, in the discretion of the Hon. the Secretary of War, military operations against him should not commence at once." His superior, Secretary of the Interior Zachariah Chandler agreed, adding that "the said Indians are hereby turned over to the War Department for such action on the part of the Army as you may deem proper under the circumstances." On February 8, 1876, General Sheridan telegraphed Generals Crook and Terry, ordering them to commence their winter campaigns against the "hostiles". The Great Sioux War of 1876–77 had begun.
Reynolds' campaign.
While General Terry stalled, General Crook immediately launched the first strike. He dispatched Colonel Joseph J. Reynolds with six companies of cavalry, who located a village of about 65 lodges and attacked on the morning of March 17, 1876. Crook accompanied the column but did not play any command role. His troops initially took control of and burned the village, but they quickly retreated under enemy fire. The US troops left several soldiers on the battlefield, an action which led to Colonel Reynolds' court martial. The US captured the band's pony herd, but the following day, the Lakota recovered many of their horses in a raid. At the time, the Army believed they had attacked Crazy Horse; however, it had actually been a village of Northern Cheyenne (led by Old Bear, Two Moons and White Bull) with a few Oglala.
Summer expeditions.
In the late spring of 1876 a second, much larger campaign was launched. From Fort Abraham Lincoln marched the Dakota Column, commanded by General Terry, with 15 companies or about 570 men, including Custer and all 12 companies of the Seventh Cavalry. The Montana Column, commanded by Colonel John Gibbon, departed Fort Ellis. General Crook commanded a third column that departed Fort Fetterman to head north. The plan was for all three columns to converge simultaneously on the Lakota hunting grounds and pin down the Indians between the approaching troops.
Battle of the Rosebud.
General Crook's column was the first to make contact with the northern bands in the Battle of the Rosebud on June 17. While Crook claimed a victory, most historians note that the Indians had effectively checked his advance. Thus the Battle of the Rosebud was at the very least a tactical draw if not a victory for the Indians. Afterward General Crook remained in camp for several weeks awaiting reinforcements, essentially taking his column out of the fighting for a significant period of time.
Battle of the Little Bighorn.
Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer and the Seventh Cavalry were ordered out from the main Dakota Column to scout the Rosebud and Big Horn river valleys. On June 25, 1876, they encountered a large village on the west bank of the Little Bighorn. The US troops were seriously beaten in the Battle of the Little Bighorn and nearly 270 men were killed, including Custer. Custer split his forces just prior to the battle and his immediate command of five cavalry companies was annihilated without any survivors. Two days later, a combined force consisting of Colonel Gibbon's column, along with Terry's headquarters staff and the Dakota Column infantry, reached the area and rescued the US survivors of the Reno-Benteen fight. Gibbon then headed his forces to the east, chasing trails but unable to engage the Sioux and Cheyenne warriors in battle.
Battle of Slim Buttes.
Reinforced with the Fifth Cavalry, General Crook took to the field. Hooking up briefly with General Terry, he soon moved out on his own but did not find a large village. Running short on supplies, his column turned south and made what became called their "Starvation March" to mining settlements to find food. On September 9, 1876, an advance company from his column stumbled across a small village at Slim Buttes, which they attacked and defeated. After reaching Camp Robinson, Crook's forces disbanded.
Crackdown at the agencies.
In the wake of Custer's defeat at the Little Bighorn, the Army altered its tactics. They increased troop levels at the Indian agencies. That fall, they attached most of the troops to the Army for operations. They seized horses and weapons belonging to friendly bands at the agencies, for fear they would be given to the resisting northern bands. In October 1876, Army troops surrounded the villages of Red Cloud and Red Leaf. They arrested and briefly confined the leaders, holding them responsible for failing to turn in individuals arriving in camp from hostile bands. The US sent another commission to the agencies. According to historian Colin Calloway, "Congress passed a law extinguishing all Lakota rights outside the Great Sioux Reservation." The Lakota never legally ceded the Black Hills to the United States.
Mackenzie's campaign.
Colonel Ranald S. Mackenzie and his Fourth Cavalry were transferred to the Department of the Platte following the defeat at the Little Bighorn. Stationed initially at Camp Robinson, they formed the core of the Powder River Expedition that departed in October 1876 to locate the northern villages. On November 25, 1876, his column discovered and defeated a village of Northern Cheyenne in the Dull Knife Fight in Wyoming Territory. With their lodges and supplies destroyed and their horses confiscated, the Northern Cheyenne soon surrendered. They hoped to be allowed to remain with the Sioux in the north. They were pressured to relocate to the reservation of the Southern Cheyenne in Indian Territory. After a difficult council, they agreed to go.
When they arrived at the reservation in present-day Oklahoma, conditions were very difficult: inadequate rations, no buffalo left alive near the reservation, and malaria. A portion of the Northern Cheyenne, led by Little Wolf and Dull Knife, attempted to return to the north in the fall of 1877 in the Northern Cheyenne Exodus. They succeeded in reaching the north. After they divided into two bands, that led by Dull Knife was captured and imprisoned in an unheated barracks at Fort Robinson without food or water. When the Cheyenne escaped on January 9, 1878, many died at US Army hands in the subsequent Fort Robinson massacre. Eventually the US government granted the Northern Cheyenne a northern reservation, the Northern Cheyenne Reservation in present-day southern Montana.
Miles' campaigns.
Another strategy of the US Army was to place troops deep within the heartland of Lakota Territory. In the fall of 1876, Colonel Nelson A. Miles and his Fifth Infantry established Cantonment on Tongue River (later renamed Fort Keogh) from which he operated throughout the winter of 1876–77 against any "hostiles" he could find. In January 1877, he fought Crazy Horse and many other bands at the Battle of Wolf Mountain. In the months that followed, his troops fought the Lakota at Clear Creek, Spring Creek and Ash Creek. Miles' continuous campaigning pushed a number of the Northern Cheyenne and Lakota to either surrender or slip across the border into Canada. Miles later commanded the US Army during the Spanish-American War.
Diplomatic efforts.
While military leaders began planning a spring campaign against the Lakota and Northern Cheyenne who had refused to come in, a number of diplomatic efforts were underway in an effort to end the war.
As the winter wore on, rumors reached Camp Robinson that the northern bands were interested in surrendering. The commanding officer sent out a peace delegation. About thirty young men, mostly Oglala and Northern Cheyenne, departed the Red Cloud Agency on January 16, 1877 to make the dangerous journey north. Among the most prominent members of this delegation was a young Oglala named Enemy Bait (better known later as George Sword). He was the son of the prominent headman Brave Bear. The delegation found Crazy Horse on the Powder River, but found no indication that he was prepared to surrender. Other Oglala camps nearby, however, were more willing to hear the message and to seriously consider surrendering at the agencies. In late February, part of the delegation continued on to find the Northern Cheyenne, where they delivered the same message.
The influential Brulé headman Spotted Tail also agreed to lead a peace delegation out to meet with the "hostiles." Departing his agency on February 12, 1877 with perhaps two hundred people, Spotted Tail moved north along the eastern edge of the Black Hills. They soon found a large village of Minneconjou under Touch the Clouds near Short Pine Hills on the Little Missouri River. After several days of councils, they agreed to go in and surrender at the Spotted Tail Agency.
Spotted Tail's delegation continued on to the Little Powder River where they met with Minneconjou, Sans Arc, Oglala and a few Northern Cheyenne, including leaders such as Roman Nose, Black Shield, Lame Deer and Fast Bull. Most of these bands also agreed to go in to the Spotted Tail Agency to surrender. Crazy Horse was not in the camp, but his father gave a horse to a member of the delegation, as evidence that the Oglala war leader was ready to surrender.
Not to be outdone by General Crook's diplomatic efforts, Colonel Miles sent out a peace initiative from his Tongue River Cantonment. Scout Johnny Brughier, aided by two captive Cheyenne women, found the Northern Cheyenne village on the Little Bighorn. They met in councils for several days. His effort would lead to a large contingent of Northern Cheyenne eventually surrendering at the Tongue River Cantonment.
On April 13, a second delegation departed the Red Cloud Agency, led by the noted Oglala leader Red Cloud, with nearly 70 other members of various bands. This delegation met Crazy Horse's people "en route" to the agency to surrender and accompanied them most of the way in.
Surrenders.
The continuous military campaigns and the intensive diplomatic efforts finally began to yield results in the early spring of 1877 as large numbers of northern bands began to surrender. In April 1877, an aide of General Crook's wrote to a friend: "I am now fully satisfied that the great Sioux War is now ended and that we will have once more a chance to have peace." A large number of Northern Cheyenne, led by Dull Knife and Standing Elk, surrendered at the Red Cloud Agency on April 21, 1877. They were shipped to Indian Territory the following month. Touch the Clouds and Roman Nose arrived with bands at the Spotted Tail Agency. Crazy Horse surrendered with his band at Red Cloud on May 5.
The famed Oglala leader Crazy Horse spent several months with his band at the Red Cloud Agency amidst an environment of intense politics. Fearing that he was about to break away, the Army moved to surround his village and arrest the leader on September 4, 1877. He slipped away to the Spotted Tail Agency. The following day, Crazy Horse was brought back to Camp Robinson with the promise that he could meet with the post commander. Instead, he was taken to the guard house under arrest. During his struggle to escape, he was fatally bayoneted by a soldier.
Flight to Canada.
While many of the Lakota surrendered at the various agencies along the Missouri River or in northwestern Nebraska, Sitting Bull led a large contingent across the international border into Canada. General Terry was part of a delegation sent to negotiate with the bands, hoping to persuade them to surrender and return to the US, but they refused.
Not until the buffalo were seriously depleted and troubles began to surface with other native tribes in Canada, did they finally return. In 1880–81, most of the Lakota from Canada surrendered at Fort Keogh and Fort Buford. US forces transferred them by steamboat to the Standing Rock Agency in the summer of 1881.
Aftermath.
The Great Sioux War of 1876–77 contrasted sharply with the Bozeman War fought a decade earlier. During the 1860s, Lakota leaders enjoyed wide support from their bands for the fighting. By contrast, in 1876–77, nearly two-thirds of all Lakota had settled at Indian agencies to accept rations and gain subsistence. Such bands did not support or participate in the fighting.
The deep political divisions within the Lakota continued well into the early reservation period, affecting native politics for several decades. In 1889–90, the rise of the Ghost Dance movement found a large majority of its followers among the non-agency bands who had fought in the Great Sioux War.
While much more numerous in total population, the bands of the Lakota generally were independent and made separate decisions about warfare. Many bands did ally with the Cheyenne, and there was intermarriage between the tribes. An alternative view is that the Plains Indians considered the war of 1876–77 to be "The Great Cheyenne War".

List of Pixar shorts

Beginning with Pixar's second film "A Bug's Life", all subsequent Pixar feature films have been shown in theatres along with a Pixar-created short. Other Pixar shorts, released only on home media, were created to showcase what Pixar can do (either technologically or cinematically), or were created specifically for a client.
The first shorts were made while Pixar was still a computer hardware company, when John Lasseter was the only professional animator in the company's tiny animation department. Starting with "Geri's Game", after Pixar had turned into an animation studio, all later shorts have been produced with a larger crew and budget.
In 1991, Pixar made four CGI shorts produced for the TV series "Sesame Street". The shorts illustrates different weights and directions starring Luxo Jr. and Luxo - "Surprise" (1992), "Light and Heavy" (1990), "Up and Down" (1993), and "Front and Back" (1994).
Also, beginning with "A Bug's Life", Pixar has created extra content for each of their films that is not part of the main story. For their early theatrical releases, this content was in the form of "movie outtakes" and appeared as part of the movie's credits. For each of their films since "Monsters, Inc." ("Finding Nemo" and "Toy Story 3" excluded), this content was a short made exclusively for the DVD release of the film. As of 2010, all of the short films except "BURN-E" and "Dug's Special Mission" are available to purchase on Apple's iTunes Store.
Short series.
In 2008, Pixar began making shorts with previously developed characters. These shorts premiered on Toon Disney, Disney Channel or as a theatrical release.
Compilations.
Pixar released "Pixar Short Films Collection Volume 1", a collection of their short films, on DVD and Blu-ray on November 6, 2007. The disc is an updated version of the earlier-released VHS tape "Tiny Toy Stories", and includes all of Pixar's shorts through 2006's "Lifted", including the short "The Adventures of André and Wally B.", which was made by Pixar in 1984 as a Lucasfilm subsidiary before it became its own company. The second volume of Pixar shorts was released on November 13, 2012.
Additional work.
Beginning with "Finding Nemo", Pixar has created additional material to serve as instructional material or as background material to illuminate aspects of a film. For straight to DVD/Blu-ray releases or theme park attractions.
Other work.
Pixar animated a series of clips featuring Luxo and Luxo Jr. for "Sesame Street", which were "Light & Heavy", and "Surprise". Pixar also produced numerous animation tests, commonly confused with theatrical shorts, including "Beach Chair" and "Flag and Waves". They also produced over 30 commercials after selling their software division to support themselves before "Toy Story" entered production. Some of their other work includes:
Furthermore, in 1988, Apple Computer's Advanced Technology Group produced "Pencil Test," a computer-animated short to showcase the Apple Macintosh II line. Although Pixar was not officially affiliated with this film, several members of the Pixar staff advised and worked on it, including directors John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, and producer Galyn Susman.

Move (Thousand Foot Krutch song)

"Move" is the second single from Thousand Foot Krutch's third studio album, "The Art of Breaking". Although "Move" received less Christian radio play than the first single, "Absolute", it did receive more mainstream radio play than "Absolute"; because of this, "Move" received a music video. "Move" charted at number 16 on the Billboard charts. 
Music video.
In the video, the band is shown playing in the cellar of an abandoned building. Also shown is a girl, who starts running once the song kicks in. The girl repeatedly bumps into various people and eventually ends up near where the band is playing. She then retraces her steps and finds that most of the people she ran into before now have some sort of metal implant. The audio in the video slightly varies from the album version. The difference is that in the beginning on the CD Trevor can be heard whispering in the song, but in the video he cannot. Also the chorus at the end of the song, in the video, is not repeated as often as it is in the CD version.
The video was directed by Brandon Dickerson and produced by Erik Press.
Awards.
The song was nominated for a Dove Award for Short Form Music Video of the Year at the 37th GMA Dove Awards.

Rembrandt in Southern California

Fourteen Rembrandt paintings are held in collections in Southern California. This accumulation began with J. Paul Getty's purchase of the "Portrait of Marten Looten" in 1938, and is now the third-largest concentration of Rembrandt paintings in the United States. "Portrait of Marten Looten" is now housed at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA).
History.
The Rembrandt Club of Pomona College in Claremont, California was established in 1905 for the promotion and encouragement of the arts. It predates all of the major art museums of Southern California. and remains active today. 
In 1907, Arabella Huntington, whose Southern California home is now the Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens, purchased Rembrandt's "Aristotle Contemplating a Bust of Homer" (1653) for her house in Paris. After her death the painting was inherited by her son Archer M. Huntington. He sold it in 1928, the year that the Huntington Library, Art Gallery, and Botanical Gardens was established. "Aristotle" was eventually purchased by the Metropolitan Museum of Art of New York in 1962, for 2.3 million dollars. At the time this was the highest amount ever paid for a painting at a public or private sale.
In 1913, the Los Angeles County Museum of History, Science, and Art opened in Exposition Park. The inclusion of the three divisions had been determined in part by the Smithsonian's configuration, and there was very little art to display. Indeed, in order to meet the deadline of the formal dedication ceremonies on November 6, 1913, the fine arts wing was not only hung with loans from Southern California collectors, but also with a number of works borrowed from East Coast owners. The opening of the museum was timed to coincide with the completion of the Owens Valley aqueduct—it was part of the celebratory festivities. This was no coincidence: the ready availability of water made the development of Southern California possible. Soon a community interested and knowledgeable regarding culture and fine arts emerged.
In the 20th century, collections of art that included paintings by old masters such as Rembrandt were highly sought after by many of America's business elite, and Southern-California collectors were no exception. Considered a newsworthy event, accounts in the "Los Angeles Times" trumpet the earliest arrivals of professed Rembrandt paintings in the Southland in 1928 and 1932. 
"An Elderly Jew in Fur Cap" (1645) was purchased by Mr. and Mrs. Fred E. Keeler of Hollywood in 1928. President and major stockholder of the Lockheed Corporation, Keeler informed the press that he and his wife hoped to build a gallery to house their pictures adjoining their home, and open it to the public. During the fall and winter of 1934-35, the "Los Angeles Sunday Times" published a series entitled "Southern California's One Hundred Finest Privately Owned Paintings." The Keeler's "Rembrandt" was featured in the first edition of the series. When Mary Keeler died in 1939, she left their collection of art to the County Museum of History, Science, and Art, without restrictions.
Another purported Rembrandt, "Portrait of a Woman with Oriental Headdress" (1635), was acquired by Mr. and Mrs. Willitts J. Hole of Hancock Park in 1932. An early twentieth century Southern California real estate developer, Hole built a private art gallery adjoining his residence, in which the collection was arranged by nationality and lit by artificial light, akin to a museum. In 1938, the Willitts J. Hole collection was donated by his daughter Agnes Hole Rindge to the University of California, Los Angeles. Soon after, on January 8, 1940, the Hole Rembrandt and many other paintings from the collection were installed in the UCLA Library.
Supported by scholars as genuine works by Rembrandt's hand at the time, both the Keeler and Hole pictures have since been reconsidered.
German art historian Wilhelm Valentiner published "Rembrandt Paintings in America" in 1931, with the inclusion of just one work in California: "St. John the Baptist" (1632), owned by newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst of Los Angeles. In 1947 when the picture was owned by Marion Davies, Hearst gave the funds to Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) to purchase it, along with eighteen other works, from her. No longer considered by Rembrandt, it is presently attributed to Govert Flinck and called "Portrait of a Bearded Man".
Already a well known art world figure, Wilhelm Valentiner came to Los Angeles in 1946 to assume the directorship of the precursor of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), the "Los Angeles County Museum." As described above, prior to a division in 1961, fine art was integrated with history and science in what is now the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County's edifice.
In 1947, shortly after arriving in Los Angeles, Valentiner organized and curated a major loan exhibition of works by Rembrandt and fellow Dutch seventeenth-century painter Frans Hals at the County Museum. The show featured paintings from a number of Southern California private collections such as Jacob M. Heimann of Los Angeles, J. Paul Getty of Los Angeles, Mr. and Mrs. Converse M. Converse of Santa Barbara, and George Huntington Hartford II of Los Angeles; and included works that are in Southern California museums today, namely the Los Angeles County Museum's "Portrait of Marten Looten" and the Hammer Museum's "Juno".
Getty gave "Marten Looten" to the Los Angeles County Museum in 1953, undoubtably convinced to do so by Valentiner. Soon after the Rembrandt expert became the first director of the newly created J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, 1954.
Shortly after the new Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) had opened in 1961, critic Howard Taubman penned an article in the "New York Times" entitled "Culture Way Out West: Los Angeles Art Museum Embarks on Long Road to First-Class Status" suggesting that there was a good deal of room for improvement. "Museum leaders have calculated the cost of upgrading various areas of their collection," he states, "To achieve a No. 1 spot in Thai art...would cost only $250,000. To approach the heights of a Rembrandt repository...would cost no less than $65 million." The article also reports a rumor about a Southern California Rembrandt that is very illuminating:
"While Los Angeles may resent signs of Eastern condescension, it has not lost its sense of humor. It is still capable of chuckling about a story, possibly only a rumor, involving a Rembrandt portrait owned by Howard Ahmanson, banker and patron of the arts. Some doubt has been cast on the authenticity of the painting's attribution, and the plan, the story has it, has been worked out for a test. There is a similar Rembrandt at the National Gallery, and the one here will be carried tenderly in the next month or two to Washington, where the two paintings will be hung and studied side by side. Wouldn't it be funny, remarked a cynical fellow the other day, if some expert opined that the one in Washington is dubious? Are you laughing back there in the East?"
Rembrandt, "Saint Bartholomew", 1661, was sold in 1962 at a Sotheby's, London standing-room only sale. Purchased by J. Paul Getty, it is now in collection of the J. Paul Getty Museum.
In 1965, Norton Simon, a Southern California businessman and major Los Angeles County Museum of Art supporter, purchased Rembrandt's "Titus" at a Christie's London auction. The result was a media commotion. The painting had been knocked down by the auctioneer to an English buyer, but Simon was able to reopen the bidding by producing a letter that proved that the auctioneer had overlooked his prearranged bidding signal. A natural genius at promotion and marketing, Simon arranged the Rembrandt portrait's American debut at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, where its debarkation from the plane was filmed for posterity. Stating that "the painting has such great beauty and universal appeal that the Norton Simon Foundation has a special obligation to exhibit it in the most favorable circumstances for the widest possible enjoyment," Simon allowed the work to be on view there for six months, where it was seen by over 300,000 visitors. That June, Simon and the Rembrandt picture made the cover of "Time Magazine". Disguised as a wrapped Christmas present and featuring a tag reading "To Mother," "Titus" made the plane trip from DC to Southern California in December 1965 
In 2008 the Hammer Museum, the J. Paul Getty Museum, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Norton Simon Museum, and the Timken Museum of Art collaborated on an intermural exhibition of Rembrandt paintings; they called it Rembrandt in Southern California.

William Louis Abbott

William Louis Abbott (23 February 1860 – 2 April 1936) was an American medical doctor, explorer, ornithologist and field naturalist. He complied prodigious collections of biological specimens and ethnological artefacts from around the world, especially from Maritime Southeast Asia, and was a significant financial supporter of the United States National Museum collecting expeditions.
Early life and education.
Abbot was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He obtained a Bachelor of Arts at the University of Pennsylvania in 1881 before studying medicine there, graduating in 1884 and subsequently doing postgraduate studies in England, obtaining licentiates from the Royal College of Physicians and Royal College of Surgeons. In 1886 he received a substantial inheritance, ceased the formal practice of medicine, and devoted himself to exploration and collecting.
Exploration and collecting expeditions.
Journeys of exploration and collecting made by Abbott include:
Post career.
In 1923, Abbott retired from active fieldwork but continued to provide funding on several occasions to the United States National Museum for other collecting expeditions. 
He died at his farm on the Elk River in Maryland of heart disease after a long illness, leaving his books, papers and 20% of his estate to the Smithsonian Institution. At the time of his death he was the largest single contributor to the collections of the museum. Abbott’s name is commemorated in the names of numerous animal taxa, including those of Abbott's Crested Lizard ("Gonocephalus abbotti"), Abbott's Day Gecko ("Phelsuma abbotti"), Abbott's Booby ("Papasula abbotti"), Abbott's Starling ("Cinnyricinclus femoralis"), Pygmy Cuckoo-shrike ("Coracina abbotti"), Abbott's Sunbird ("Cinnyris sovimanga abbotti") and Abbott's Duiker ("Cephalophus spadix").

North Star (sternwheeler 1902)

"North Star" was a sternwheel steamboat that operated in eastern Washington from 1902 to 1904. This vessel should not be confused with the other vessels, some of similar design, also named "North Star". 
Construction.
The "North Star" was built at Wenatchee, Washington in 1902 by George Cotterell for the Columbia & Okanogan Steamboat Company, which Captain Alexander Griggs (1828-1903) was the principal owner.
Operations.
"North Star" operated out of Wenatchee on the Columbia and Okanogan rivers. On September 3, 1902, "North Star" was wrecked in Entiat Rapids. The company was able to salvage the vessel. In 1907 at Wenatchee, "North Star" was rebuilt and enlarged by the veteran shipwright Alexander Watson. (Another source states that the vessel was sold to H.S. DePuy & Will Lake and renamed "Enterprise", and a new vessel, also called "North Star" was built in 1907. A third source states the vessel was rebuilt.)
Withdrawn from service.
Settlement in the Okanogan region decreased starting in about 1910. As a result, business declined so much that by 1915, the Columbia & Okanogan Steamboat Co. was forced to take all of its boats out of service. of its boats at Wenatchee, and "North Star." The company had made arrangements to sell "North Star" to Captain Fred McDermott, who was considering taking the vessel further up the Columbia, to run between Pateros and Bridgeport. 
Destruction by fire.
The sale of "North Star" had not been finalized when on July 8, 1915, fire broke out on "North Star" when she was rafted up at Wenatchee with the rest of the company's remaining boats, the "Columbia", "Okanogan", and "Chelan". "North Star" was the outermost vessel, but the fire soon spread to the other three. All the vessels were rapidly and completely destroyed, and although the hull of the innermost vessel, "Chelan" remained afloat, the damage to that vessel was beyond repair. There was no insurance. The Columbia & Okanogan Steamboat Co. had so little money that they were planning to use some of the proceeds of the anticipated sale of "North Star" to pay the insurance premiums on the remaining three vessels. The cause of the fire was never determined.

Piti (food)

Piti is a soup in cuisines of Caucasus and Central Asia prepared in the oven in individual crocks with a glazed interior (called "piti" in Turkic languages). It is made with mutton and vegetables (tomatoes, potatoes, chickpeas), infused with saffron water to add flavour and colour, and cooked in a sealed crock. Piti is served in the crock, usually accompanied by an additional plate for "disassembling" the meat and the liquid part with vegetables, which may be eaten separately as the first (soup with vegs) and second (meat) course meal.
Piti is particularly popular in Azerbaijan, Iran (where it is mostly called Dizi or Abgusht), Tajikistan, and Armenia (where it is called "putuk" from the Armenian word for crock).

India–Ivory Coast relations

The bilateral relations between the Republic of India and the Republic of Ivory Coast have considerably expanded in recent years as India seeks to develop an extensive commercial and strategic partnership in the West African region . The Indian diplomatic mission in Abidjan was opened in 1979. Ivory Coast opened its resident mission in New Delhi in September 2004. Both nations are currently fostering efforts to increase trade, investments and economic cooperation.
Commercial and economic relations.
According to the Indian ambassador to Ivory Coast, India plans to invest $1 billion into developing oil and mining projects over the next five years. In the last ten years, the total amount of announced Indian FDI abroad has been more than $10 billion. From India's energy security viewpoint, Ivory Coast has emerged as an important destination for investment opportunities in hydrocarbon exploration and diamonds. Recent BBC reports have drawn attention to the emerging importance of Africa in India’s foreign economic policy and the special role that West Africa is now occupying. India hopes to tap into the region's vast oil wealth by accessing the Gulf of Guinea's shoreline.
Oil production in Ivory Coast stands at more than 60,000 barrels per day. India's ONGC has already invested $12m to explore an offshore block in the region, that it is now drilling.
India is also facilitating the development of an IT-cum-Technology Park in Abidjan, named after Mahatma Gandhi. India's Minister of State for Commerce, Jairam Ramesh, has said both countries are also cooperating in new areas such as pharmaceuticals, transport, water supply and telecommunications. Addressing the second Indo-Ivory Coast Joint Trade Commission, the Indian Commerce Minister stated that India wanted to establish a "strategic partnership" with Ivory Coast to develop diamond mining, cutting and polishing, which would offer employment to the local population.
India's Tata Steel and SODEMI (Ivorian state-owned company for mineral development) have entered into a Joint Venture Agreement (JVA) for the development of Mount Nimba Iron ore deposits in Ivory Coast (West Africa). The Mt Nimba deposit, spread over 3 countries - Liberia, Guinea and Ivory Coast, is one of the biggest in the Africa. With Ivory Coast still maintaining its status as the economic powerhouse of French West Africa, India is looking to open new factories in the country. Ivory Coast's Minister of Mines, Energy and Petroleum, Monnet Leon, has also urged India to make use of Ivory Coast's vast mineral resources, including bauxite, limestone, iron ore, manganese, nickel, gold and diamonds which have not been significantly explored. Ivory Coast's business community has proclaimed that India, being the world’s largest democracy, can help Ivorians cement democracy in their country and bring in stabilisation through economic process. India has also been one of the largest troop contributors to the UN peace-keeping mission in the Ivory Coast.
India’s new economic diplomacy in Africa.
In a bid to expand its economic reach, India launched an initiative in 2004 called Techno-Economic Approach for Africa–India Movement (TEAM–9), together with eight energy- and resource-rich West African countries, including Ivory Coast, Senegal, Mali, Guinea-Bissau, Ghana, and Burkina Faso. According to the Indian Ministry of External Affairs, the initiative was part of a broader policy to engage the underdeveloped, yet resource-wealthy countries of West Africa, which required both low-cost technology and investment to develop their infrastructure. In particular, India increasingly wants to play an important role in helping Ivory Coast and other West African countries channel their energy resources more efficiently.
Ambassador Shamma Jain also states that there is also a growing demand for courses run by ITEC and SCAAP on information technology, rural credit, small- and medium-scale industries, women’s entrepreneurship and quality control, which is creating a ‘constituency of interest’ in India. In August 2006, Ivorian Foreign Minister Youssouf Bakayoko led a 110-member delegation, comprising top Ivorian entrepreneurs and government ministers, to the Indo-Ivorian trade commission meeting in New Delhi, where they drafted dozens of agreements to be signed later in the year.
In January 2009, Ivory Coast conferred its highest award upon the Indian Minister of State for External Affairs Anand Sharma. India's Deputy Foreign Minister Sharma accompanied by Ambassador Shamma Jain and a high-level delegation discussed an entire gamut of issues during his visit to Ivory Coast with President Laurent Gbagbo that included the UN reforms, expansion of the UN Security Council and reshaping of the global financial infrastructure. Ivory Coast expressed its vociferous condemnation of the 2008 Mumbai attacks and the forces behind it and reiterated its solidarity with India in its combat against terror. President Gbagbo reaffirmed his government's appreciation of India's leadership role, its economic strength, and above all, its willingness to share its expertise, technology and development experience with African countries. Against this backdrop, in a gesture that underlined the special ties with India, President Laurent Gbagbo conferred the Commander of the National Order, the country's highest civilian award in recognition of the Indian Foreign Minister's distinct role in strengthening India's relationship with Ivory Coast and the African continent.

Early Chinese cartography

Cartography or mapmaking (in Greek "chartis" = map and "graphein" = write) is the study and practice of making representations of the Earth on a flat surface. Cartography combines science, aesthetics, and technical ability to create a balanced and readable representation that is capable of communicating information effectively and quickly. However, most of the record in the history of cartography is based on Europe, not mentioned so much in Chinese history. Native Chinese geography begins in the Warring States period (5th century BC). It expands its scope beyond the Chinese homeland with the growth of the Chinese Empire under the Han Dynasty. It enters its golden age with the invention of the compass in the 11th century (Song Dynasty) and peaks with 15th century (Ming Dynasty) Chinese exploration of the Pacific under admiral Zheng He.
Maps in Ancient China, a classical legend.
There is a classical Chinese legend called “He Bo Xian Tu” about the ancient map. It is said that in the time of “Dayu’s Taming of the Floods” (roughly during the Xia Dynasty), a river god gave Dayu a stone with a flood map etched upon its surface. Dayu used this map to hold back the flooding that threatened to devastate the rural agriculture. Another account attributes Dayu's deeds as a marvelous feat of engineering.
In general, the development of early Chinese cartography experienced three phrases: primitive map, classical map, and survey map. The primitive maps were simple maps, still steeped in myth and legend. It wasn't until the Han Dynasty that classical maps began to emerge.
Earliest reference to map from the Qin Dynasty.
Qín or Ch'in (Wade-Giles) (秦), (9th century  BC-221 BC) was a state during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods of Chinese history, which eventually grew to dominate the country and unite it for the first time under the Qin Dynasty. 
The earliest reference to a map in Chinese history can be found in the "Records of the Grand Historian", Volume 86, "Jingke Biography". This records an event in 227 BC when Crown Prince Dan of Yan had his assassin Jing Ke visit the court of the ruler of the State of Qin, who would become Qin Shi Huang (r. 221–210 BC), the first Emperor of China. Jing Ke was to present the ruler of Qin with a district map painted on a silk scroll, rolled up and held in a case where he hid his assassin's dagger. Handing him the map of the designated territory was the first diplomatic act of submitting that district to Qin rule. Instead he attempted to kill Qin in a failed assassination plot. From then on maps are frequently mentioned in Chinese sources.
Qin State maps.
In 1986, seven maps were found in Tomb 1, dating to the Qin State of the Warring States period, at Fangmatan in Gansu province. The maps are drawn in black ink on four rectangular pieces of pine wood, 26.7 cm in length and between 15 and 18.1 cm in width, and depict the tributary river systems of the Jialing River in modern Sichuan province. The areas covered by the seven maps overlap, but in total they cover 107 × 68 km in area.
In addition to the seven maps on wooden blocks found at Tomb 1 of Fangmatan, a fragment of a paper map (5.6 × 2.6 cm) was found on the chest of the occupant of Tomb 5 of Fangmatan in 1986. This tomb is dated to the early Western Han, so the map dates to the early 2nd century BCE. The map shows topographic features such as mountains, waterways and roads, and is thought to cover the area of the preceding Qin Kingdom.
Han Dynasty maps.
The Han Dynasty (; 206 BC–220 AD) followed the Qin Dynasty and preceded the Three Kingdoms in China. The Han Dynasty was ruled by the prominent family known as the Liu clan. The reign of the Han Dynasty, lasting over 401 years, is commonly considered within China to be one of the greatest periods in the history of China. To this day, the ethnic majority of China still refer to themselves as the "Han people".
So far, the exact evidence of map is dated back from Han Dynasty, that is 168 BC ago. And from that time, there already had very exquisite map in ancient China. The three maps on the silk found at Mawangdui tumulus dated to the 2nd century BC in the Han Dynasty. These three maps are a topography map of Changsha region, a military map of southern Changsha and a prefecture map.
The research of three maps indicate that China already had a very exact cartography skills in Han Dynasty. Although there have not map name, legend, scale and any other explanation, in the military map there already displayed the Hunan, Guangdong and Guangxi region and depict the political boundary between the Han Dynasty and Nanyue, where the region covered from 111°E to 112°30′E, and from 23°N to 26°N. And the map scale is about 1:180000.
At the time of its discovery, they were the oldest maps discovered in China until 1986, when Qin Dynasty maps dating to the 4th century BC were found.
Maps in Ming Dynasty.
The Ming Dynasty (), or Empire of the Great Ming (), was the ruling dynasty of China from 1368 to 1644, following the collapse of the Mongol-led Yuan Dynasty. The Ming was the last dynasty in China ruled by ethnic Hans (the main Chinese ethnic group), before falling to the rebellion led in part by Li Zicheng (李自成) and soon after replaced by the Manchu-led Qing Dynasty. Although the Ming capital Beijing fell in 1644, remnants of the Ming throne and power (collectively called the Southern Ming) survived until 1662.
The period from Yuan Dynasty to Ming Dynasty, which have more than 300 years, was a long time of feudal dynasty period in China history. During this period, Chinese cartography did not have too much important development, but became much more mature in traditional cartography skills and there had more types of map. Such as, national map of mountains and cities, military defense map, coast defense, river defense map for flood control and nautical chart for marine navigation. And the characters of these map are: Based on China district area, mathematical basis using traditional methods, concentrating on accuracy of rivers and hills.
In 1579, Luo Hongxian published the Guang Yutu atlas, including more than 40 maps, a grid system, and a systematic way of representing major landmarks such as mountains, rivers, roads and borders. The Guang Yutu incorporates the discoveries of naval explorer Zheng He's 15th century voyages along the coasts of China, Southeast Asia, India and Africa.
Among maps in Ming Dynasty, Zhenghe map chart was the most influential nautical chart. Between 1405 and 1433, the Ming government sponsored Zhenghe a series of seven naval expeditions to visit countries in Asia, Africa, and beyond. Thus, the Zhenghe map was the important one in Chinese cartography history and a specific map for marine navigation. And it had some special characteristics in presentation content and method:
Ming Dynasty had a developed map making method. Especially in the late Ming Dynasty, when the western rising natural scientific technology was gradually spread to China by some western Boanerges, the cartography skill had much more development. And at that time, the world map drawing by western was firstly imported to China and add material and area of China in it, which have a great influence in Chinese traditional cartography.
[[File:Da-ming-hun-yi-tu.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The Da Ming Hun Yi Tu map, dating from about 1390, is in multicolour. The
horizontal scale is 1:820,000 and the vertical scale is 1:1,060,000.]]
The Great Ming Amalgamated Map or Da Ming Hun Yi Tu (- "characters in left-to-right order", Manchu: "dai ming gurun-i uherilehe nirugan") is a world map created in China. It was painted in colour on stiff silk and 386 x 456 cm in size. The original text was written in Classical Chinese, but Manchu labels were later superimposed on them.
It is one of the oldest surviving world maps from East Asia although the exact date of creation remains unknown. It depicts the general form of the Old World, placing China in the center and stretching northward to Mongolia, southward to Java, eastward to central Japan, and westward to Africa and Europe.
The Earth's curvature affects even the scale of the Chinese section of the map. Horizontally, it works out at about 1:820,000; but vertically it is around 1:1,060,000. The use of colour is particularly effective within China itself, including elegant touches like the ochre tint of the Huang He (Yellow River).
The recently rediscovered Selden Map of China dating from the early seventeenth century, which shows a series of precisely plotted maritime routes, has provoked a reassessment of the global significance of Ming cartography.
Survey map in Qing Dynasty.
The Qing Dynasty (; Manchu: Daicing gurun; ), also known as the Manchu Dynasty, was the last ruling dynasty of China, ruling from 1644 to 1912 (ostensibly with a brief restoration during the short-lived Empire of China).
When the time of Emperor Kangxi’s reign in Qing Dynasty and because of import of western cartography skills, he realized Chinese map were not accurate enough and needed scientific methods to mapping. Thus he sponsored a national wide geodesy and mapping based on astronomical observation and triangulation measurement. It took ten years to complete the map named Huang Yu Quan Lan Tu from 1708 AD, which was the first on-the-spot survey map. It had 41 framings based on province boundary and have following characteristics:
Besides cartography, the unification of scale measurement and the field measurement of meridian of earth are both contributed to the development of cartography in Qing Dynasty and help to improve quality of maps in a great deal.

Liturgical Calendar of the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church

Syro Malabar Church has its own seasons around the year. They are fixed according to the flow of salvation history. Concentrating themselves on 'Iso M'siha, i.e., on the historical life of Jesus Christ, the believers are led to the eschatological fulfilment, viz., the heavenly bliss, in this special arrangement of liturgical seasons.
Mar Toma Nazranis (St. Thomas Christians) begin their liturgical year on the Sunday that comes between November 27 and December 3.
Seasons and Salvation History.
The arrangement of the Seasons in the Liturgical Year is based on Six Central Events on Celebrations of the Salvation History. They are:
Fixing of Seasons.
All seasons begin on Sundays. 52 weeks are divided into Nine Seasons. Usually, there are seven weeks each for every Season; the first and last are permanent exceptions; five or six for "Subara" and four for "Qudas-Edta".
Resurrection of "Iso-M'siha" and Finding of the Glorious Cross are the two deciding Celebrations in the Liturgical Year. Resurrection is celebrated on the Sunday that follows the full moon day after March twenty first, the Spring Equinox.
Finding of the Glorious Cross is celebrated always on September fourteenth.
The Seasons.
Weeks of Annunciation ("Subara").
It is a season of Good News, viz., the Season of the Annunciation of Salvation.
Weeks of Epiphany ("Denha").
The public life of "Iso-Msiha" is celebrated during the Weeks of Epiphany.
Weeks of Great Fast ("Sawma Rabba").
During the Weeks of Great Fast, "Mar Toma Nazranis" celebrate the Passion and Death of 'Iso-Msiha'
Great Sunday of Resurrection (2000-2099).
In the Syro-Malabar Church, Great Sunday of Resurrection is always celebrated on a Sunday between March 22 (M22) and April 25 (A25) as per the calculations based on the Catholic Tradition. It is the first Sunday after the Paschal Full Moon, which is the first moon whose 14th day is on or after the "vernal equinox". Here are the dates of the Great Sunday of Resurrection from 2000 to 2099. Years are arranged row-wise in an ascending manner. For better alignment, March and April are bifurcated. Identify the year and look at the column header to find the exact date.

Nasrani Calendar: An Online Dynamic Liturgical Calendar.
Nasrani Foundation, an organisation of Mar Thoma Nasranis has developed a dynamic Calendar based on the liturgical seasons of Syro-Malabar Church. The calendar is a handy tool for those who want to organize their life according to the liturgical seasons of the Church. The calendar contains almost all the information on the liturgical year of the Syro-Malabar Church. The calendar also provides instant access to daily Bible verses and short articles on important feasts of the Syro-Malabar Church. Pre-recorded Bible verses (from Peshitta Bible) and biblical reflections written by well-known theologians on Sundays and feast days are of most help to the faithful. Moreover, one can opt for receiving email alerts based on the calendar. Using this calendar, Syro-Malabar faithful can keep themselves updated with the liturgical life cycle of the Church.

Immobilized enzyme ESR

Immobilized Enzyme ESR (IE-ESR) is an electron spin resonance (ESR) technique used to detect short lived radicals generated from enzyme reactions. This method is an alternative to the more commonly used continuous-flow or fast-flow ESR method. The IE-ESR method was developed in the laboratory of Roanld P. Mason at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences/National Institutes of Health (NIEHS/NIH) by post doctoral fellows Bradley E. Sturgeon and Yeong-Renn Chen. The IE-ESR method was first used to detect the tyrosine iminoxyl radical. This radical is the 1-electron oxidized form of nitrosotyrosine that was a results of the tyrosyl radical reacting with nitric oxide. A second publication using the IE-ESR method showed the increase in peroxidase activity of cytochrome c as a result of HOCl treatment. The complete paper describing the method was published in 2003.

Manitoba Provincial Road 587

Manitoba Provincial Road 587 is a former provincial road in the Canadian province of Manitoba. It is a gravel road.
Route description.
The route began on the east side of Bowsman at PR 266 and ended at PR 268, eleven miles east of the village. Six miles east of Bowsman it intersected PR 366. The route's main purpose was to provide a connection from Bowsman to rural areas east of the village, and eventually to the Lenswood Highway. The route's most important feature was a ford crossing over the Swan River. However in 2006 it was removed due to environmental issues and the fact that it would wash out nearly every spring. Because of this, the road is no longer a direct route to PR 268, and large detours must be made via Lenswood or PR 366 to access areas on the east side of the Swan River.
Legacy.
The route is no longer signed as PR 587 ultimately because of the ford crossing decommissioning described above. The portion from Bowsman to Craigsford is now a part of PR 366, which turns south at Craigsford and connects with PTH 10 near Minitonas. This part of the route continues to be heavily used. The portion of the route from Craigsford to the Lenswood Highway has seen a sharp decline in traffic since the ford crossing's removal, especially the easternmost end of the road. It is now used primarily for access to local farmland. Some provincial roadsigns still remain along this part of the route.

Albert Boime

Albert Boime (March 17, 1933 – October 18, 2008) was a scholar and author on art history who was a professor of art history at the University of California, Los Angeles for three decades, until his death.
Early life.
Albert Isaac Boime was born on March 17, 1933 in St. Louis, Missouri. He earned a bachelor’s degree in art history from University of California, Los Angeles in 1961 after completing service in the United States Army. He followed up in the field with a master's and a doctorate from Columbia University in 1963 and 1968 respectively. He was a professor at the State University of New York at Stony Brook from 1968 until 1972, when he left to teach at the State University of New York at Binghamton, remaining there until 1978. He joined the faculty of UCLA in 1979.
Writings.
Boime wrote some 20 books of art history, focusing not only on style and form, but using a Marxist and psychoanalytic analysis of the social and political contexts of art, examining how artworks are representations of the class, economic, power and social structures and racial attitudes that exist at their creation.
His first book, "The Academy and French Painting in the Nineteenth Century", published in 1971 by Phaidon Press, examined the unintended role of the conservative Académie des Beaux-Arts in the development of 19th-century painters. In 1974, art critic and commentator Hilton Kramer of "The New York Times" called the book "the indispensable text" for a reconsideration of the merits of the Salon painters, as the book demonstrated the web of connections in the cultural and institutions of the time that affected artistic tastes and aspirations of that time.
His book series, "The Social History of Modern Art", analyzed French art from the mid-18th century to the end of the 19th century, making connections between the art and subject matter to historical events at the time, such as the French Revolution and the rule of Napoleon Bonaparte. The four-volume, 3,000-page series, published over a two-decade period by the University of Chicago Press, includes "Art in an Age of Revolution, 1750–1800" (1987); "Art in an Age of Bonapartism, 1800–1815" (1990); "Art in an Age of Counterrevolution, 1815–1848" (2004); and "Art in an Age of Civil Struggle, 1848–1871" (2007).
The Starry Night painting.
An analysis of Vincent van Gogh's "The Starry Night" by Boime convinced him that the images in the painting's night sky were not a fanciful artwork, but was the result of Van Gogh's observations of the sky from the window of the asylum in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence at 4 a.m. on June 19, 1889, the day he wrote his brother that he had completed the painting. In a 1985 lecture to the American Astronomical Society, Boime compared the positions of the moon and Venus that night and showed that they corresponded to the positions of the celestial objects in the painting, noting that the scene "tallies with astronomical facts at the time the painting was executed."
Death.
A longtime resident of Los Angeles, Boime died at age 75 in his home there on October 18, 2008 of the bone marrow disorder myelofibrosis.

Richard Parsons (convict)

Richard Parsons, a sawyer and convict of the colony of New South Wales (now Australia), was one of four free or ticket-of-leave men and the half proprietor of a boat who set off on a timber getting mission from Sydney bound for Illawarra in 1823. The men were caught in a severe storm and driven north 728 km seeing their boat smashed at the northern end of Moreton Island off the coast of Brisbane, becoming possibly the first Europeans to live in the area and the first to discover the Brisbane River.
Prior to this a number of earlier explorers had sailed the Moreton Bay area. Most notable was Matthew Flinders who spent 15 days in the general vicinity during his 1799 expedition from Port Jackson to Hervey Bay. Due to the difficulty of finding coastal rivers by seaward exploration, none of these explorers became aware of the existence of the Brisbane River. Later in 1823, when the Surveyor General, John Oxley, was commissioned by Governor Brisbane to find sites for further penal settlements, he made a trip to the Moreton Bay area. If it was not for a chance meeting with one of Parson's surviving partners, Thomas Pamphlett, and the men telling him of a large freshwater river they had stumbled across some months earlier, Oxley may never have made the exploration that lead to the establishment of Brisbane Town some years later.
By the time of Oxley pulled into Moreton Bay, Parsons was gone. Mistakenly believing that they were somewhere south of Sydney he had set of north on foot. His two companions began to travel with him but, upon reaching the Mooloolah River, Pamphlett decided to return to live with the Moreton Bay natives they had befriended earlier. Later John Finnegan also returned, having quarelled with Parsons upon reaching the Noosa River. Parsons went on, he believed as far as 'four of five hundred miles'. Most believe this distance to be much exaggerated but he may well have gone as far as present day Central Queensland before he, as he later said, 'began to suspect his error by the extreme heat he felt, as he advanced.'
Parsons eventually returned to Bribie Island from where he was Picked up by Oxley on 11 September 1824 and he finally came back to Sydney on 15 October alongside John Oxley's party on board the Government brig "Amity". A brief account of his story was subsequently printed in "The Australian".

Antonio Gramusset

Antonio Gramusset (1740–1784) was a French adventurer living in Chile, and one of the co-conspirators in the Conspiracy of the Tres Antonios.
He was born in Premelieu, and arrived to Chile around 1764. Once there, he first tried to become a priest, and later he joined a military regiment composed of foreigners, as a cadet. Soon after he abandoned that career too, in order to try to become rich by renting a parcel of land and dedicating himself to agriculture. He also dabbled as an inventor, and developed an impracticable scheme to supply water to Santiago.
In 1780, he joined Antonio Berney and José Antonio de Rojas in a plan to establish Chile as an independent republic. They were soon discovered, denounced and arrested on January 1, 1781. He and Berney, because being foreigners, were sent as prisoners first to Lima and then to Spain to be tried. The ship that was carrying them, the "San Pedro de Alcantara", went down in front of the coasts of Portugal during a storm. Gramusset survived the sinking but died three months later due to the exposure suffered.

Johnnys is also an abbreviation for "Johnny's Jimusho" and also for the talents signed to the agency. For the sake of convenience in Japan, the group is often called "First Generation Johnny's" or "Founding Johnnys". For those considered to be "bishōnen" the term "Johnnys Type" is used. The word, despite referring to one male's looks, is not to be mistaken for the word "Ikemen".
Their debut single "Wakai Namida" (1964) was composed by Hachidai Nakamura with the lyrics by Rokusuke Ei. Nakamura and Ei formerly made the music and lyric of Kyu Sakamoto's U.S. "Billboard" Hot 100 number-one single "Sukiyaki."

Morgan (CTA station)

Morgan/Lake is a station on the Chicago Transit Authority's Green and Pink Lines.
The original station on this site was closed and demolished in early 1949; after years of intense lobbying by local residents and members of the Fulton Market Merchant Association, the Chicago Department of Transportation rebuilt the station from 2010–2012. The new station opened on May 18, 2012.
History.
The first station.
The first Morgan station was one of the 29 stations along the Lake Street Elevated Railroad when the line opened in 1893. Service to Morgan operated continuously until April 4, 1948, when the newly created CTA closed the station, due to low ridership and an attempt to speed up and simplify rail service along the line. Soon afterward, the station was demolished. The neighborhood continued to receive elevated service at the Halsted Street station, two blocks to the east.
Other former services.
Halsted continued to serve the neighborhood until January 9, 1994, when the CTA closed the Green Line for an rehabilitation and renovation project. This project included the closure of six stations, and among them was the Halsted station. With the closure of Halsted, no Green Line stations remained in the West Loop or Fulton Market areas, leaving a gap of between stations at Ashland and Clinton . The closure of Halsted was unpopular, and since that date, community residents, businesses, and local organizations have argued that this area needs a new "infill station" to restore rail service. Heightening the need for a new station, significant amounts of growth have occurred near the line in the last 15 years, including large residential buildings and many popular restaurants and nightclubs.
New station.
Morgan was a logical location for a new station, as it lies roughly halfway between Ashland and Clinton, and the intersection of Morgan/Lake is close to much of the new development in the area. It also sits near many art galleries that have opened recently, as well as Oprah Winfrey's Harpo Studios, a major tourist attraction. In the early 2000s, the CTA began to work with local groups and city officials to plan and identify funding sources for the new station. Initially, the neighborhood planned to cover the entire cost with funding from a local tax increment financing district. Later, however, the Chicago Department of Transportation decided to seek federal Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement (CMAQ) Program funding to cover $8 million of the cost, allowing some of the TIF money to be used for other purposes. The final cost of building the station was $38 million.
Construction began in Summer 2010. TranSystems led the design team, in conjunction with Ross Barney Architects. Like most currently active Green Line and Pink Line stations, Morgan is ADA-accessible, with an elevator on either side of the tracks. The station will also have bike storage.
The new Morgan station officially opened on May 18, 2012, and grand opening ceremonies were held on May 24.

1972 Australian Touring Car Championship

The 1972 Australian Touring Car Championship was a CAMS sanctioned national motor racing title open to Improved Production Touring Cars and Group E Series Production Touring Cars. The championship, which was the 13th running of the Australian Touring Car Championship, began at Symmons Plains and ended at Oran Park after eight rounds.
1972 would be the final time the Improved Production cars would contest the ATCC. From 1973, CAMS introduced a new production based Group C touring car formula. Outright cars like the Ford Mustangs, Chevrolet Camaro's, Norm Beechey's Holden Monaro and Ian Geoghegan's Ford XY Falcon GTHO Phase III would be replaced with production based Ford Falcon's and Holden Torana's. Many Improved Production cars would end up racing as Sports Sedan's in the following years.
Defending champion Bob Jane won his fourth and final Australian Touring Car Championship in his Chevrolet Camaro ZL-1. Unlike 1971 when Jane's Camaro used the 7.0 litre 427 V8 engine, CAMS rule changes reducing the engine capacity limit to 6000cc him forced to run the 5.7 litre 350 V8. Second in the championship was the Ford Escort Twin Cam Mk.1 of Mike Stillwell who's consistent placings in the under 2.0 litre class saw him finish 11 points behind Jane. Third was Allan Moffat in his Ford Boss 302 Mustang.
Although he was not classified after not scoring a point, the 1972 championship saw Peter Brock make his ATCC debut driving a Holden LJ Torana GTR XU-1 for Harry Firth's Holden Dealer Team.

Championship points were awarded on a 9-6-4-3-2-1 basis for the first six placings in each class at each round.
In addition, points were awarded on a 4-3-2-1 basis for the first four outright placings, irrespective of class, at each round.
The title was awarded to the driver gaining the highest total of points in any seven of the eight rounds.

Shortly after they departed a fierce storm that blew them out to sea and they were forced to go 21 days without water. During this time Thompson died and was buried at see a few days later, his friends not being able to put their boat ashore. The three survivors were beached on Moreton Island on 16 April 1823 and made friends with the local Aborigines.

Uttar Pradesh Legislative Council

The Uttar Pradesh Vidhan Parishad () or the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Council is the upper house of the bicameral legislature of Uttar Pradesh state in northern India.
Uttar Pradesh is one of the six states in India, where the state legislature is bicameral, comprising two houses: the Vidhan Sabha (Legislative Assembly) and the Vidhan Parishad (Legislative Council). The Vidhan Parishad is a permanent House, consisting of 100 members.
History.
The Uttar Pradesh Vidhan Parishad came into existence by the Government of India Act of 1935. The Governor was a part of it, as heretofore. The Legislative Council consisted of 60 members. The term of a member of the Council was nine years with one-third of its members retiring after every three years. The Houses enjoyed the right of electing their Presiding Officers known as the President. The first meeting of the Legislative Council was held on 29 July 1937. Sir Sitaram and Begum Aijaz Rasul were elected the President and the Vice-President of the Legislative Council respectively. Sir Sitaram was in office till 9 March 1949. Chandra Bhal became the next Chairman on 10 March 1949.
After the independenc and adoption of the constitution on 26 January 1950 Chandra Bhal was re-elected the Chairman of the Legislative Council and continued in office till May 5, 1958. Sri Nizamuddin was elected the Deputy Chairman of the Council on May 27, 1952. He continued in office till 1964.
Nominations and election.
When, under the provisions of the Government of India Act 1935, the Legislative Council came into existence in the United Provinces, it comprised 60 members. On 26 January 1950, the total membership of the Vidhan Parishad (legislative council) of Uttar Pradesh state was increased from 60 to 72. With the Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act 1956, the strength of the Council was enhanced to 108. After the reorganisation of Uttar Pradesh state in November 2000 and the creation of Uttarakhand state, this strength has now reduced to 100.

Enkichi Ōki

Count was a Japanese statesman in the Taishō period.
Ōki was born in Tokyo, Shizuoka Prefecture. His father, Ōki Takatō was one of the leaders in the Meiji Restoration, and served in numerous cabinet posts in the early Meiji government. In 1899, Enkichi succeeded to his father’s title of count ("hakushaku") under the "kazoku" peerage system. His political career began in 1908, when he was elected to the House of Peers. He initially supported the "Kenkyukai", but soon switched his allegiance to the "Rikken Seiyukai". He was appointed Justice Minister under the cabinet of Prime Minister Hara, a post which he also held under the succeeding Takahashi administration. In 1923, he cooperated with Home Minister Tokonami Takejiro to introduce tightened anti-subversive legislature in response to increasing leftist agitation in the labor disputes, and the public emergence of the Japan Communist Party. Ōki was subsequently Railroad Minister under the Kato and Kiyoura administrations.

The Term of the Vidhan Sabha is five years unless dissolved earlier. The election for it is held on the principle of "one adult one vote".
History.
Pre-independence.
The Legislative Assembly for the United Provinces was constituted for the first time on 1 April 1937 in accordance with the Government of India Act, 1935. The strength of the Assembly as stipulated under the Act of 1935 was 228 and its term was five years. Sri Purushottam Das Tandon and Sri Abdul Hakim were elected the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker respectively on 31 July 1937.
Post-independence.
After Independence, the Legislative Assembly met for the first time on 3 November 1947. At its meeting on November 4, 1947, the Legislative Assembly adopted a resolution for the use of Hindi for the transaction of all its business and proceedings and accordingly all the business of the House was thereafter transacted in Hindi.
On February 25, 1948, the Assembly passed a resolution requesting the Governor to submit to the Governor General the request of the Assembly to the effect that the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad and the Oudh Chief Court be amalgamated.
Another important Resolution passed by the House on October 18, 1948 congratulated the Government of India, the military commanders and the soldiers on their successful police action against the Hyderabad State.
Post-republichood.
The first session of the U. P. Legislature (a provisional legislature) under the new Constitution, began on February 2, 1950 with an address by the Governor to both the Houses assembled together in the Assembly Hall. Prior to the commencement of the session, the Governor administered the oath to Hon'ble Sri P. D. Tandon and Hon'ble Sri Chandra Bhal respectively in their respective chambers. Thereafter all other members present took oath or made affirmation, as required by the Constitution, in their respective Houses.
An important legislative measure passed in 1950 was the U. P. Language (Bills and Acts) Act, 1950, which provided that the language to be used in Bills and Acts shall be Hindi in Devanagri script. In 1951, the U. P. Official Language Act was passed adopting Hindi in Devanagri script as the language to be used for official purpose of the State.
On 11 August 1950 the Hon'ble Speaker Sri Purshottam Das Tandon resigned from his office. On 21 December 1950 the Deputy Speaker, Hon'ble Sri Nafisul Hasan was elected the Speaker. During the course of his reply to the congratulatory speeches on the occasion, he declared that unlike his predecessor, he would not be taking part in politics as long as he remained the Speaker.
Sri Hargovind Pant was elected the Deputy Speaker on January 4, 1951.
After the first elections.
The newly elected Assembly of Uttar Pradesh met on May 19, 1952. On May 20, 1952, Hon'ble Sri Atma Ram Govind Kher was elected the Speaker. During the course of his reply to the congratulatory speeches made on the occasion, he said that of the two different conventions set by his two predecessors in office in the matter of taking part in politics he would like to follow neither but would strive to follow a middle course in this regard. He said that he would not take part in active politics nor hold any office in the Congress Party to which he belonged, but at the same time he would continue to be a member of that party and take part in non-controversial activities, particularly relating to social and developmental work.

Turnera hermannioides

Turnera hermannioides is a distylous, diploid perennial restricted to open, sandy sites in northeastern Brazil. Four populations sampled in Sergipe contained equal proportions of long- and short-styled plants. The style and stamen dimorphism in floral morphs is associated with differences in pollen size and pollen production. In contrast, flower size, ovule number, and seed fertility of the morphs are not significantly different. A controlled pollination program demonstrated that individuals of "T. hermannioides" possess a self- and intra-morph incompatibility system. The only pollinations resulting in significant seed production were between the floral morphs. Populations of "T. hermannioides" grow intermingled with "T. ulmifolia", a widespread polymorphic complex containing forms that resemble "T. hermannioides". A crossing program between "T. hermannioides" and diploid and tetraploid varieties of "T. ulmifolia" revealed barriers to hybridization particularly in crosses at the diploid level. It is concluded that "T. hermannioides" is a restricted diploid species that is reproductively isolated from "T. ulmifolia".

Jacob Arvey

Jacob M. Arvey (November 3, 1895 – August 25, 1977) was an
influential Chicago political leader from the Depression era until the mid-1950s. He may be best known for his efforts to end corruption in the Chicago Democratic organization, and for promoting the candidacies of liberal Democratic politicians such as Adlai Stevenson and Senator Paul Douglas of Illinois. He was known as "Jake" and "Jack" at different times in his career.
Early life and political career.
Arvey was the son of Israel and Bertha (née Eisenberg) Arvey, poor Jewish immigrants from Russia. He grew up in Chicago's 24th political ward in the North Lawndale neighborhood on the city's West Side. Arvey never attended college, but did study law, served as a clerk in a Chicago law firm, and eventually passed the Illinois bar exam and became an attorney. On June 11, 1916 he married Edith Freeman; they would remain married until his death in 1977. They had three children: Erwin, Helen and Howard Arvey.
In 1923 Arvey was elected to the Chicago city council from his native 24th ward. Known as "Jake" Arvey, he was the third-ranking member of the powerful political machine led by Chicago Mayor Ed Kelly. A superb political organizer, his organization consistently turned out the largest Democratic majorities (often nine-to-one) of any ward in Chicago, thus enhancing his influence and reputation among the city's Democrats. Reflecting on the qualifications he required for someone to serve in his organization, Arvey once commented that ""Every man had to belong to a church, a lodge, some other group. He had to be active in the Elks, Masons, K of C, places where he could spread the word about the Democratic Party ... if an apartment was vacant and you moved in, the precinct captain was there to welcome you. He'd get the electricity turned on, perhaps get milk for your children; he'd help with your tax problems. Our organization is geared to the masses, our candidates depend on the precinct captain and our captains are trained to go into the home and make personal contact with the voter.""
During World War II Arvey temporarily left his political career to serve as a colonel in the U.S. Army; he was the judge advocate of the 33rd Infantry Division, Illinois' National Guard unit, in the Pacific theater of the war. 
Leader of the organization.
When Arvey returned from the war in 1945 he was appointed commissioner of the Chicago Park District, and served until 1967. From 1946 to 1950 was also the Chairman of the Cook County Democratic Party. Now known as "Colonel" or "Jack" Arvey, he found that the Chicago Democratic organization was in trouble due to numerous scandals and charges of corruption. To improve the organization's reputation and its electoral chances, Arvey began promoting the candidacies of reformers and liberals; he also made a serious effort to clean up the city's politics. He forced Chicago Mayor Edward Joseph Kelly, his former boss and mentor, to resign as mayor when a voter revolt appeared; Arvey instead promoted and helped elect as mayor a prominent businessman, Martin Kennelly. 
In 1948, Arvey had the Chicago Democratic organization nominate Adlai Stevenson II, grandson of U.S Vice President Adlai E. Stevenson, for Governor of Illinois and Paul Douglas, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago, for U.S. Senator. Both men were well-educated liberals whom Arvey felt would improve the image of the party and attract many independents and moderate Republicans. To improve their chances of winning Arvey joined with several other prominent Democrats, such as Florida Senator Claude Pepper and New Jersey party leader Frank Hague, to try and prevent incumbent President Harry S. Truman from winning the Democratic presidential nomination. Truman was trailing the GOP presidential candidate, Thomas E. Dewey, in the polls, and Arvey feared that Truman would lose by a wide margin in Illinois and drag Stevenson and Douglas to defeat with him. Arvey and his allies promoted the candidacy of General Dwight D. Eisenhower, but the plan failed when Eisenhower refused to run (in 1952 he revealed that he was a Republican and won the GOP nomination). Arvey reluctantly agreed to support Truman for the nomination. However, in a major upset Truman won Illinois – and the election – by a narrow margin. Both Stevenson and Douglas won their respective elections by landslide margins – Stevenson defeated his GOP opponent, incumbent Governor Dwight Green, by 572,000 votes. 
During his years as governor Stevenson formed an effective working partnership with Arvey. Stevenson agreed to appoint qualified Democratic Party loyalists and workers to lesser positions in the state government; in return Arvey agreed to support Stevenson's efforts to reform the state government, and in particular to end corruption in the Illinois state police by removing hiring practices from political considerations.
Political decline.
Arvey's political influence greatly declined after 1950. The Democratic ticket he had assembled was marred by scandal and the Democrats lost the crucial office of Sheriff. Arvey then resigned under pressure from the county chairmanship, although he remained active in politics. From 1950 to 1972 Arvey was a member of the Democratic National Committee for Illinois, a prominent if not powerful role.. Arvey played a role in securing the 1952 Democratic presidential nomination for Stevenson. However, as a presidential candidate Stevenson increasingly ignored Arvey and other professional Democratic politicians in favor of reformers and liberals in the party. In 1955, Richard J. Daley, an Arvey protégé, was elected Mayor of Chicago. He allowed Arvey to retain his positions on the Park District Board and the Democratic National Committee, but Arvey's influence was limited.
Death.
Jacob Arvey died of heart failure in Chicago's Weiss Memorial Hospital on August 25, 1977, aged 81 and was buried in Chicago. He was survived by his wife and their three children.

Richard Gehman

Richard Boyd Gehman (May 20, 1921 in Lancaster, Pennsylvania- died May 20, 1972) was a prolific American author of more than 3,000 magazine articles (including over 400 features), five novels and 15 nonfiction books. Gehman also wrote under many different pen names, including Meghan Richards, Frederick Christian, Martin Scott, Michael Robinson and F.C. Uffelman.
Biography.
Gehman attended McCaskey High School in Lancaster and worked on several daily newspapers in Lancaster before joining the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in World War II, serving four years as a writer for "The Oak Ridge Times" in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. After the war he moved to Greenwich Village in New York City and began freelancing for Esquire, Life, Time, Cosmopolitan, Colliers, Argosy, True, Saga and Good Housekeeping magazines. Gehman was an original Contributing Editor at Playboy. 
Gehman's circle of friends included many well-known American writers and editors including Maurice Zolotow, Eli Waldron, Morton Thompson and Anthony Hecht.
Maurice Zolotow once claimed that Gehman wrote an entire issue of Cosmopolitan using more than a dozen different pen names; the truth is that Gehman wrote two or three of the principle articles for one issue, each under a different name, plus a record review under the name “Meghan Richards,” and possibly one other regular column. In those days Cosmopolitan used a graphic, diagonal cover banner to highlight special features. Cosmopolitan's editors had a mock-up cover made whose banner bore the legend: "The All Richard Gehman Issue." 
Mark Evanier describes Gehman as "a prominent author of his day, specializing in celebrity profiles. He often got access to follow stars around for a few weeks so he could interview them extensively and report on what he observed..." 
Gehman married five times. His third wife was Academy Award Winning actress Estelle Parsons from 1953 to 1958, and his fourth wife, Betsy Holland Gehman, wrote "Twins: Twice the Trouble, Twice the Fun". Gehman fathered at least nine children, including actress Martha Gehman; magazine writer, poet, and belly dancer Pleasant Gehman; and Eddie Gehman Kohan, a co-creator of Will & Grace, who is founding editor of the digital archive of food and agriculture for the Obama presidency, Obama Foodorama. 
Along with several other bonvivants, Gehman was a "shadow member" of "The Rat Pack." Gehman appeared as himself in the Jerry Lewis movie The Patsy.
Selected works:
Novels:
Musical Comedy:
Gehman taught writing at:
In the early 1960s Gehman was hired by TV Guide magazine, for which he wrote many articles focused on celebrities. Gehman believed that creative people were often emotionally insecure because of an unhappy childhood, and that those who became celebrities in the entertainment industry sometimes did so because their insecurity motivated them to succeed.

Guy Anstruther Knox Marshall

Sir Guy Anstruther Knox Marshall (20 December 1871 Amritsar, Punjab - 8 April 1959 London), was an Indian-born British entomologist and authority on Curculionidae.
He was the youngest of three children born to Colonel Charles Henry Tilson Marshall (1841-1927), a district judge, and Laura Frances Pollock (1846-1912), daughter of Sir Frederick Pollock, 1st Baronet and Chief Baron of the Exchequer. Both Guy's father and his uncle, Major-General George Frederick Leycester Marshall (1843-1934), were naturalists who had produced books on the birds and butterflies of India, Burma, and Ceylon.
Marshall was sent from India to a school in Margate where he started a butterfly collection. He transferred his attentions to beetles when he enrolled at Charterhouse. When he failed the Indian Civil Service entrance examination, his father shipped him off to Natal in South Africa to learn sheep farming. He ended up in Rhodesia, managing the "Salisbury District and Estates Company" and owning two farms, one managed by Swynnerton.
Marshall corresponded with the prominent Darwinian, Edward Bagnall Poulton, Hope Professor of Zoology at Oxford University who had written "The Colours of Animals" (1890). Poulton urged Marshall to study insect colours in mimicry and camouflage. Throughout this research project Marshall put together a collection of plant specimens from southern Africa. His findings were published as a joint paper in "Transactions of the Entomological Society of London" in 1902.
Poulton later helped Marshall in obtaining an appointment at Sarawak Museum. Marshall, however, became ill during a stay-over in London. When some of his papers on weevils were published, he was offered an appointment as scientific secretary to the "Entomological Research Committee (Tropical Africa)." The Committee's function was to post field entomologists to East and West Africa who would study insects harmful to humans, crops and animals and send specimens to the Natural History Museum in London for identification. Under Marshall’s management the Committee grew into a powerful and efficient body. Eventually all the agricultural information services were merged as the "Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux" (CAB). Marshall established the biological control service at Farnham House, giving rise to a global network of laboratories and creating two scientific publications: the "Bulletin of Entomological Research" and the "Review of Applied Entomology".
Marshall's organisation took on the enormous task of writing up the ‘"Insecta"’ division of The Zoological Record. In 1916 he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Oxford for his contribution to economic entomology. He was elected Honorary Fellow of the Royal Entomological Society of London 
Other honours were showered upon him - he was elected to the Royal Society, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Royal Society of New Zealand, the Indian Institute of Science, the Royal Belgian Entomological Society, and the Russian Entomological Society. He was awarded "l’Ordre de la Couronne" from the Belgian Government, a CMG in 1920, a knighthood in 1930, and with his retirement in 1942, the KCMG.
Marshall's identification work at the institute led to his extensive knowledge of insect taxonomy. His specialising in the Curculionidae was by accident rather than design, as they were the only group left intact after a trip to England in 1896. In total he wrote up some 2300 new species in some 200 papers. After his retirement the Natural History Museum set aside office space for his taxonomic work, with which he continued until shortly before his death.

USS Wave (1836)

USS "Wave" was a schooner in commission in the United States Navy from 1836 until probably 1846.
"Wave" was a schooner-rigged yacht designed along pilot boat lines by John C. Stevens and built for him in 1832 at New York City by Brown and Bell. The U.S. Navy purchased her in 1836 for use in the Second Seminole War. In that campaign, she cruised the Florida coast in support of United States Army operations until 1840. After 1840, "Wave" served as a surveying vessel along the United States East Coast under the command of Lieutenant John R. Goldsborough.
In his "History of the American Sailing Navy", Howard I. Chapelle suggests that she was sold in 1846. However, no evidence has been found to corroborate or refute that assertion. Chapelle also states that as of the time of his book's publication in 1949, a model of "Wave" resided in the New York Yacht Clubs model room.

Meuse Press

Meuse Press http://meusepress.tripod.com/Meuse.htm is an Australian Press publishing a range of “poetry outreach” projects in a number of media ranging from a literary magazine to poetry published on the surface of a river. Founded by Bill Farrow & Les Wicks. Mostly edited/curated by the poet Les Wicks, but others in editorial roles have included Bill Farrow, Geoff Aldridge, Grant Caldwell, Deidre Kelsall, Carol Chandler, Marvis Sofield & Barbara De Franceschi .
Initially it was an occasional magazine and an insert into other publications and anthologies. The first issue was in 1977. Publication of most of Australia’s leading poets of the time was accompanied by graphics and the magazine was a market leader in merging these two art forms.
From 1992 - 1999 Meuse published Artransit which put poetry/art collaborations on Newcastle and Sydney buses and ferries. This collection has been exhibited in London, New York, St Louis, Sydney (multiple times), Maroochydore and Brisbane. Historian Robert Holden has said “They engage a truly democratic audience.

In 2002, in conjunction with Don Gunn produced Heritage Light with Parramatta City Council. This series of banners, soundscapes and projected poetry sought to reconnect citizens with their city at night whilst simultaneously celebrating heritage Week. A key part was the publishing of a poem on the surface of the Parramatta River so that it appeared to float downstream. This was widely regarded as a world first.
1998-2003 Written in Sand was displayed in bus shelters across Waverley with council support. This was a project designed to capture a picture of the area – its people, landscapes and history - through poetry. 2009 saw the launch of the e-anthology "Guide to Sydney Beaches" aimed at an audience new to poetry. 2010 saw from this Broken Hill - a celebration of the famous outback city. In 2011, "AU/UA Contemporary Poetry of Ukraine & Australia" was produced in cooperation with Krok Press - a first attempt to explore both nation's poetries in both languages. It was edited by Les Wicks, Yury Zavadsky & Grigory Semenchuk. http://meusepress.tripod.com/AUUA.pdf
Since April 2000, Meuse has produced Australian Poetry Collaboration. This online ezine publishes poetry arising from events like festivals, workshops and tours within Australia (though one issue celebrated the Festival International de la Poesie).

History.
In 1946, Bill Zimmer and his wife, Roberta, bought a small downtown jewelry store in Wilmington, North Carolina and changed the name to Reeds Jewelers. Later, Reeds opened a store in Whiteville, Jacksonville, and other cities in both North and South Carolina. Bill Zimmer built Reeds' business on the foundation of customer service and respect, which he deemed the Reeds Promise. He would often tell his associates: "The most important thing I've learned is that you never argue with a customer. You've just got to do right by people." He carried that philosophy into his treatment of employees, vendors and customers alike, stating that his priorities were to "treat all my people like I'd want to be treated, I respect them and I let them know they were loved and appreciated." By 1979, Reeds Jewelers maintained two dozen retail outlets. Alan Zimmer joined Reeds Jewelers as executive vice president in 1981 and took charge of merchandising. He officially became president and CEO in 1985.
In December 1986 Reeds Jewelers sold 600,000 shares on the NASDAQ, trading under the symbol REEDS. The company’s share of the proceeds, $3.7 million were used in the acquisition of Dreifus Jewelry Company of Memphis, a nineteen store chain in the Southeast and Midwest, and a year later Gray's Jewelers, Inc., a five store chain based in Tulsa, Oklahoma. In 1995 Reeds Jewelers purchased Melart Jewelers, a mid-Atlantic based jeweler operating stores in Maryland, DC, and Pennsylvania. In 1998 Reeds Jewelers moved to the American Stock Exchange and traded using the symbol RJI. In February 2004 the company returned to private ownership by the Zimmer family, making it the largest family owned jeweler in America.

2009 Australian Grand Prix

The 2009 Australian Grand Prix (formally the LXXIV ING Australian Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held on 29 March 2009 at the Melbourne Grand Prix Circuit, Melbourne, Australia. It was the first race of the 2009 Formula One season. The race, contested over 58 laps, was won by Jenson Button for the Brawn GP team after starting from pole position. Rubens Barrichello finished second in the second Brawn GP car, with Jarno Trulli third for Toyota.
Brawn GP became the first constructor since Mercedes-Benz at the 1954 French Grand Prix to qualify on pole position, and then go on to win the race on their Grand Prix debut. The race also became the second race in Formula One history to finish under stabilised safety car conditions—after the 1999 Canadian Grand Prix—following a collision between Robert Kubica and Sebastian Vettel, who were running second and third, on lap 56.
Report.
Background.
The Grand Prix was contested by 20 drivers, in 10 teams of two. The teams, also known as constructors, were Ferrari, McLaren-Mercedes, Renault, Brawn-Mercedes, Force India-Mercedes, BMW Sauber, Toyota, Red Bull Racing-Renault, Williams-Toyota and Toro Rosso-Ferrari.
The race saw the debut of Brawn GP, whose owner Ross Brawn had bought out Honda Racing F1. The Brawn cars were driven by Honda's former drivers Rubens Barrichello and Jenson Button. The race also saw the debut of Sébastien Buemi, driving for Toro Rosso. Buemi became the first Swiss driver in Formula One since Jean-Denis Délétraz in 1995. Buemi replaced Sebastian Vettel who had moved to Red Bull Racing replacing the retired David Coulthard.
Prior to the opening race of the season, McLaren and Renault planned to boycott the season opener due to money not being paid to the teams. However, the boycott was avoided and both teams arrived in Melbourne for the opening round. In a second dispute, several teams protested to the stewards about the legality of the Brawn, Toyota and Williams cars, with arguments that the diffuser on the cars were illegal. The protest was thrown out by stewards. However, the teams that initially protested, had appealed against the decision, with a FIA International Court of Appeal hearing set for after the Malaysian Grand Prix. At the hearing, the diffusers were deemed legal.
The race itself saw a later start time, Having started at 15:30 AEDT (04:30 UTC) in 2008, the race was moved to 17:00 AEDT (06:00 UTC) for 2009. However, the executives of the Australian Grand Prix rejected calls from Bernie Ecclestone to move it to a night race, just like the one held in Singapore, as they want to honour their current contract to 2015 of a twilight race.
Practice and qualifying.
Three practice sessions were held before the race; the first was held on Friday morning and the second on Friday afternoon. Both sessions lasted 1 hour and 30 minutes with weather conditions dry throughout. The third session was held on Saturday morning and lasted an hour, and was also dry throughout. The Williams cars of Nico Rosberg and Kazuki Nakajima set the pace, ending up first and second with only five-hundredths of a second splitting the two. The only other driver that was within half a second of them was Kimi Räikkönen's Ferrari, who was marginally behind Nakajima. Rubens Barrichello set the fourth fastest time in the first official session for the Brawn team, outpacing team-mate Jenson Button, who could only muster up the sixth fastest lap. Heikki Kovalainen was the faster of the two McLaren drivers in fifth, with team-mate and reigning world champion Lewis Hamilton languishing all the way down in 16th, some 2.3 seconds off the pace of the Williams cars. Rounding out the top ten were Felipe Massa's Ferrari, the Toyota of Timo Glock, Adrian Sutil's Force India (thus meaning that four of the six Mercedes–engined cars were in the top ten) and the first of the Renaults driven by Fernando Alonso.
Rosberg was again the pace-setter in the second practice session, with a time some six tenths of a second faster than what he achieved during the first 90-minute session. This time, Barrichello was second in his Brawn with the Toyota of Jarno Trulli in third. This marked an improvement for Trulli as he was only 12th in the first session. The only Australian in the field, Mark Webber ended up fourth for Red Bull Racing, ahead of Button, Glock and Nakajima. Webber's team-mate Sebastian Vettel was eighth, after a morning session that was interrupted by a hydraulic failure which led him to pull his car off the road between turns six and seven. This ruled him out of the rest of the session, and restricted him to bottom of the timesheets and only four laps completed. Rounding out the top ten were Sutil's Force India, which ended up ninth again, and Massa in tenth. The three teams running the controversial rear diffusers (Brawn, Williams, and Toyota) were consistently the best teams on the track.
Rosberg completed a clean sweep of top spots in practice, by coming fastest in Saturday's practice session. His time edged out Trulli's Toyota by just three thousandths of a second. Button was third, and the only other driver to break into the 1:25 lap times, just under two tenths of a second behind Rosberg. Massa improved again to end up fourth, and be the only driver from McLaren or Ferrari to finish in the top ten. Nakajima again impressed in the Williams, finishing fifth, in front of Barrichello, Webber, and Glock, who took the next three fastest times and were split by around six hundredths of a second. The two BMW Sauber drivers—Robert Kubica and Nick Heidfeld—rounded out the top ten, as they appeared in the top ten on the timesheets for the first time, after a fraught pair of practice sessions on Friday.
The qualifying session was split into three parts. The first part of qualifying runs for 20 minutes and eliminates the cars that finished the session 16th or lower. The second part of qualifying lasts for 15 minutes and eliminates cars that finished in positions 11 to 15. The final part of qualifying lasts for 10 minutes and determines the positions from first to tenth, and effectively decides who starts the Grand Prix in pole position. After dominating all three practice sessions on Friday, and again on Saturday morning, Rosberg did not fare so well in qualifying, managing a time only good enough for fifth position. The Brawn cars of Button and Barrichello dominated qualifying with the Brazilian finishing first in the first two parts of the session. In the third session, Button managed to beat his team-mate's time by three tenths of a second, and secured the fourth pole position of his career and his first pole since the 2006 Australian Grand Prix, that ended with Button's car blowing its engine on the final straight. Vettel's Red Bull was third with team-mate Webber in tenth at his home race, which would later become eighth after the disqualification of the Toyotas. Kubica improved even further to line up fourth, easily outpacing team-mate Heidfeld, who did not make the third session and was running the KERS system, which Kubica was not. After Glock was demoted, Massa was promoted to sixth and was the best KERS runner, ahead of team-mate Räikkönen, with Heidfeld and Alonso completing the top ten, after the Toyotas' disqualification. After the session, Hamilton was demoted five places as his gearbox had to be changed, which originally dropped him from 15th on the grid, to 20th. Some hours after Hamilton's penalty, the Toyota cars had their times declared void as the rear wing on their cars was deemed to be illegal. This pushed Hamilton up to 18th, with Glock in 19th and Trulli 20th.
Race.
The conditions on raceday were similar to what had been seen on both Friday and Saturday, the air temperature at ; clear skies throughout, with the race beginning at 17:00 AEDT. Button led away and retained his pole position lead into turn one. He was closely followed by Vettel, Rosberg, Massa, Kubica and Räikkönen. Those six led away and were unaffected by the chaos that occurred behind, in turn one. After near-stalling, Barrichello had dropped from second to ninth, and challenged up the inside of Webber's Red Bull as they entered turn one. After being hit from behind, Barrichello's left front tyre impacted with the right-hand sidepod of Webber's car which half-spun the Australian into the BMW Sauber of Heidfeld. Once Barrichello had emerged relatively unscathed, Webber impacted on the front left of Kovalainen's McLaren causing irreparable damage to the left front suspension of the Finn's car. At turn three, Massa attempted a move down the inside of Rosberg, forcing the German off course and as a result, falling behind the Brazilian. At the end of the lap, Webber, Sutil and Heidfeld all pitted to repair damage caused in the first corner incident.
Further down the field, reigning champion Hamilton was progressing through the field having started eighteenth. After the first corner incident, he moved up to 13th at the end of the first lap. He passed Bourdais for 12th on lap two, Fisichella for 11th on lap three, and broke into the top ten, after passing Buemi on lap four. Out front, Button was beginning to establish a lead of over four seconds by the time he set the fastest lap on lap six, with a lap of 1:28.787. Vettel was still running second ahead of Massa, Kubica, Räikkönen with Rosberg completing the top six. Hamilton attempted to pass Piquet for ninth, doing so at Turn 13.
On lap ten, Rosberg attempted a move on Räikkönen into turn one, and succeeded to move up into fifth place on track. In the process, Räikkönen was slowed up by the German's move, allowing Barrichello to close up on the straight that leads into Turn 3. The Brawn car closed up thanks to picking up the slipstream, but even this left him several car lengths behind the Ferrari as they entered the braking zone for the corner. Barrichello's car snaked under brakes, and clipped the back of Räikkönen's car, causing more damage to his car. Räikkönen was forced wide by the hit, and Barrichello's momentum initiated a passing move into Turn 4, succeeding and moving into sixth place. The Finn pitted at the end of the lap, changing from the option tyre, onto the prime compound and did not change compounds again for the remaining distance.
Massa and Hamilton both pitted on lap eleven, with both drivers changing from the option tyres, moving onto the harder rubber. This allowed for a scrap for third to begin between Kubica, Rosberg and Barrichello to occur, as the latter two had caught up on the Pole. It would only last one lap however, as Kubica pitted on lap twelve, the final driver to change his first stint super-softs. Out front, Button continued to lead by 4.3 seconds from Vettel with Rosberg third, Barrichello fourth and Nakajima fifth. Lap 16 saw both Vettel and Rosberg pit, with Vettel remaining in second and Rosberg fell to 12th. Rosberg was delayed by a slow left front tyre change, which was a major contribution to his nine-place fall in the race.
On lap 18, whilst running in fourth place, Nakajima ran slightly wide on the exit of Turn 4 and proceeding to put too much power down spinning the car sideways and head on into the wall between Turns 4 and 5. After hitting the wall, his front wing ended up in the middle of the track and directly on the racing line. Button made his pit stop a lap later, and exited pit lane as the safety car was deployed. After the field cycled through, the safety car eventually picked up Button and would remain on the track until the end of lap 24.
At the restart, Button held position out front, ahead of Vettel, Massa, Kubica – who was still weaving his car to get temperature into his tyres "after" he had crossed the start/finish line – and Räikkönen. In a battle for sixth, Piquet had lined up a move on sixth-placed Rosberg, causing the German to defend on the inside. However, Piquet lost control of his car under braking – and possibly due to the tyres not being up to the required temperature – and spun off into the turn one gravel and out of the race. Further down the field, Glock lost two places to Hamilton and Alonso, as both drivers attacked hard on the restart.
Positions remained the same until lap 31, when Massa made his second and final pit stop of the race and emerged back into the fray in 14th place. After returning to the race, Massa was told by race engineer Rob Smedley to step up his pace, as according to him Kubica and Räikkönen were a threat due to longer middle stints. Trulli pitted on lap 33, having made his first pit stop on lap 10. A lap later, Kubica set the fastest lap, with a 1:27.989, and two laps later, the Pole bettered that by a thousandth of a second – his fastest lap of the race. At this point, Button was still extending his lead over Vettel, leading by over five seconds from the German.
Kubica pitted from third place on lap 39, and rejoined the circuit in seventh, just behind Hamilton, who was still making his way up the field. At the same time, Räikkönen made his second stop and rejoined in ninth. Buemi had quietly made his way up into fourth place, just in front of the Brit, before he made his second and final pit stop on lap 41. Two laps later, Räikkönen made an error whilst exiting Turn 13, and spun off, glancing the wall on the right hand side. He eventually returned to the pits, to make an unscheduled pit stop. Also pitting this lap was Hamilton, then running in third place. It was a close-run thing at pit exit, but Hamilton did enough to hold off Massa and rejoined in tenth position.
Rosberg and Vettel pitted on consecutive laps, trying to limit the amount of time that they would have to spend on the super-soft tyre. Both drivers held station in seventh and second positions respectively. At this time, Massa was slowly exiting the race with suspension damage, limping round before retiring the Ferrari in pit lane. Button pitted for the final time on lap 47, and suffered a very slow stop, with a sticking left rear wheel change, with the pit stop lasting 13.2 seconds. A lap later, Rosberg set the fastest lap of the race – 1:27.706 – and was still closing on Glock. Glock and Barrichello both pitted late on, and the race order on lap 55 was Button, Vettel, Kubica, Barrichello, Trulli, Hamilton, Glock, Alonso, Rosberg and Buemi.
Lap 56 saw Vettel make a slight mistake in Turn 1, and allowed Kubica to make a run down the outside, towards Turn 3. Vettel braked early and Kubica was ahead turning in. However, Vettel turned in and his front wing locked onto the sidepod of Kubica's BMW. Due to this collision, both cars lost their front wings, but they carried on towards Turns 4 and 5. Kubica was ahead, but without downforce he understeered off the circuit into the wall and out of the race. Meanwhile, Vettel also made an error on the way into the corner, sliding and hitting the wall, causing his left front tyre to bend back on itself. He carried on, as he was still in the points at this time. He could only continue on for just over a lap, as he ground to a halt between Turns 10 and 11. As the debris wasn't cleared up in time, this led to only the second safety car finish in Formula One.
As stated by Article 40.14 of the sporting regulations for Formula One, the safety car pulled in and the drivers proceeded over the line without overtaking. Button secured a debut victory for Brawn after leading the race from start to finish. He led home team-mate Barrichello as they completed a Brawn one-two. Trulli finished third although there were accusations that he passed Hamilton under the safety car. This would later turn out to be true, and he was penalised twenty-five seconds pushing him down to 12th in the results, thus promoting Hamilton to third. This decision was later reversed: Trulli was eventually re-instated to his 3rd finishing position and Hamilton was disqualified for misleading stewards during their investigation. Glock finished fourth, having started from pit lane, and was followed home by Alonso, Rosberg, Buemi and Bourdais. Buemi's two points made him Switzerland's first points scorer since Marc Surer at the 1985 Italian Grand Prix.
Post-race.
The top three finishers on the road appeared on the podium and in the subsequent press conference, where Button reflected on a somewhat easy race, in which he led all 58 laps, although it wasn't without its problems: "The first few laps of the race were great for me and I could settle into a pace, but then when the safety car came out I struggled massively to get heat into the tyres. The car was hitting the ground and just before the safety car pulled in I flat-spotted the tyre pretty severely. I was struggling quite a bit with vibration and with the poor light as well. Being in the front it should be easy, but it was not easy at all." He also reflected on his and his team's achievements, as they became the first driver/team combination since Juan Manuel Fangio and Mercedes at the 1954 French Grand Prix to win the team's debut race, having started from pole position:
Barrichello picked up his first podium since the 2008 British Grand Prix, and his highest finish since the now-infamous 2005 United States Grand Prix, in which only the six Bridgestone-shod cars started due to safety concerns with Michelin's tyres. He praised the strength of his Brawn car, as he was involved in several incidents during the race. He also reflected upon his fluffed start, which ultimately led to the first of his incidents, at Turn 1. "I hit anti-stall, so the car went into neutral. I recovered quite quickly but then I lost a lot of pace compared to people and I was hit from behind from a McLaren and that put me sideways and I hit someone really hard. I thought the car was done from that crash but I survived quite well, but on my first stint my nose was falling apart and I lost the braking stability when I hit Kimi as well. He closed the door and I couldn't avoid him. I had a lot of mixed emotions during the race, but it was fantastic. I started second but could only hope for one better but after the start I am delighted to be here with the second place."
Trulli was pleased with his third place on the road, but was however, unaware of the penalty that he was due to receive for his late race pass of Hamilton under the safety car. "Well, after yesterday's disappointment this was a great day, especially for my team. I started from the pit and I was lucky enough to get away from the first corner accident. From that time on I was just pushing, pushing, pushing really hard because the car was good."
After an investigation, stewards deemed that Sebastian Vettel was in the wrong after his collision with Robert Kubica, which resulted in both of them not finishing the race. Vettel received a fine and a 10-place grid penalty to be applied in the following round in Malaysia. Red Bull Racing, Vettel's team, also received a $50,000 fine for letting him continue with a damaged car, for over a lap.
Also after the race, Trulli's third place was put under investigation. The stewards decided that the Italian regained his position overtaking Hamilton during a safety car period, having run off the track when the safety car was out. Trulli was penalised 25 seconds, moving him down to 12th. Trulli's explanation of the incident was: "When the safety car came out towards the end of the race Lewis Hamilton passed me but soon after he suddenly slowed down and pulled over to the side of the road. I thought he had a problem so I overtook him as there was nothing else I could do." In public Hamilton corroborated this, stating that the McLaren team had told him to let Trulli repass. Behind closed doors, however, Hamilton told the stewards that he had received no instruction to allow Trulli past, and had not consciously done so. Toyota had appealed the penalty firstly to the stewards, but that appeal was rejected, as a team cannot appeal a time penalty—in lieu of the fact that the offence occurred within the last five laps of the race—in accordance with Article 16.3 of the Sporting Regulations for Formula One. Toyota then appealed to the clerk of the course, Tim Schenken, but later retracted this appeal stating that: "Having considered recent judgements of the International Court of Appeal, it is believed any appeal will be rejected."
The Trulli/Hamilton case was reopened to examine new evidence, and both drivers were summoned to a stewards' inquiry prior to the Malaysian Grand Prix. Ostensibly at the urging of his team, Hamilton continued to insist he had not received orders to allow Trulli past, even after being played an audio recording of such an instruction being received over his team radio. The stewards decided that Hamilton and McLaren had misled them, having contradicted the available evidence. Hamilton was disqualified and McLaren stripped of their constructors' points. Trulli was re-instated into third place. McLaren's Sporting Director, Dave Ryan, was subsequently suspended by the team the day after Hamilton's disqualification was announced. McLaren were summoned to appear before the FIA on 29 April 2009 to answer charges of breaching the International Sporting Code. At this meeting, McLaren were given a suspended three-race ban, which would only be applied if a similar offence occurred within the next twelve months. It was revealed that Dave Ryan had been sacked by McLaren.
As this was the first race of the season, Button led the Drivers' Championship with 10 points, followed by Barrichello on 8 and Trulli on 6. Meanwhile in the Constructors' Championship, Brawn picked up a maximum 18 points thanks to the 1–2 for Button and Barrichello. This gave them a seven point lead over Toyota, with Renault on four points, thanks to Alonso's fifth place.

Ferromolybdenum

Ferro molybdenum is an important iron-molybdenum alloy, with a molybdenum content of 60-70% It is the main source for molybdenum alloying of HSLA steel.
Production.
The alloy is produced by heating a mixture of molybdenum(VI) oxide MoO3, aluminium, and iron. The oxide and the aluminium combine via an aluminothermic reaction to give molybdenum in situ. The ferromolybdenum can be purified by electron beam melting or used as it is. For alloying with steel the ferromolybdenum is added to molten steel before casting. Among the biggest suppliers of ferromolybdenum in Europe are the English trading house Derek Raphael and Co Ltd and the German trading house Grondmet in Düsseldorf, Germany. A large ferromolybdenum producer in the US is Langeloth Metallurgical Company in Langeloth, Pennsylvania.

Julius von Flotow

Julius von Flotow; full name- Julius Christian Gottlieb Ulrich Gustav Georg Adam Ernst Friedrich von Flotow (March 9, 1788- August 15, 1856) was a German military officer and lichenologist born in the village of Pitzerwitz (Polish-Pstrowice) in the region of Neumark.
In 1813, he suffered a serious war-related injury, from which he never fully recovered. During a military campaign in France (1819), he took the opportunity to study lichens native to the Ardennes Mountains. In 1832 he took an early retirement from the military and worked as a private scholar in Hirschberg. Among his written works are the following:
In 1856 he was awarded an honorary degree from the University of Breslau. The genus "Flotovia" from the botanical family Asteraceae is named in his honor.

Policeman Bluejay

Policeman Bluejay or Babes inn Birdland is a children's novel written by L. Frank Baum and illustrated by Maginel Wright Enright. First published in 1907, it has been considered one of the best of Baum's works.
The book.
In 1906 Baum wrote, and his publisher Reilly & Britton published, a set of six tales for young children, called "The Twinkle Tales" after their little-girl protagonist. The six were issued in separate chapbooks, but later collected into a volume titled "Twinkle and Chubbins: Their Astonishing Adventures in Nature-Fairyland". The series was a hit; Reilly & Britton sold 40,000 copies of the little books in a short time. Such commercial success justified a sequel: Baum took his Policeman Bluejay character from the Twinkle Tale "Bandit Jim Crow" and cast him in a separate novel, to be issued the following year.
Baum published many works — adventure stories, melodramas, and juvenile novels — under pseudonyms; early experience had taught him that he ended up "competing with himself" if he released too much material under his own name. Both "The Twinkle Tales" and "Policeman Bluejay" were printed under the pen name "Laura Bancroft" — the only Baum fantasy works published under a pseudonym. Tongue-in-cheek, Katharine Rogers has called "Policeman Bluejay" "her best work..." Oz author and "Royal Historian" Jack Snow thought "Policeman Bluejay" Baum's finest fantasy apart from the Oz books.
"Policeman Bluejay" was another success for Baum and his publishers; a second edition appeared in 1911 under the alternative title "Babes in Birdland." The third edition of 1917, also under the new title, dropped the pseudonym and acknowledged Baum's authorship. The book was issued in a facsimile edition in 1981, and was printed again in the second issue of the annual "Oz-story Magazine" in 1996. A volume that combined all the "Bancroft" material appeared in 2005.
The illustrations.
Maginel Wright Enright was in her mid-twenties, and still near the start of her artistic career, when she created the illustrations for "The Twinkle Tales" and "Policeman Bluejay". Her pictures for the "Bancroft" books have been described as having "a child-like grace, a clear clean outline, and a sometimes highly refined decorative sense."
The theme.
The "Bancroft" works of 1906 and 1907 are united by a general concept: kindness to animals rather than cruelty. Baum recalled from his own childhood, and observed in his own sons, how harsh children can be to vulnerable animals. Baum wrote a preface to "Policeman Bluejay" that expressed this goal unambiguously; he noted that along with the "amusement" the story provides, he hoped it would inspire "a little tenderness for the helpless animals and birds" his young readers encountered in their lives.
This goal motivated the most extreme element in "Policeman Bluejay" — the hunting scene in Chapter IX, "The Destroyers," an extraordinarily violent scene in a story designed for young children.
Synopsis.
At the story's start, Twinkle and Chubbins are lost in a "great forest." They encounter a "tuxix" — a creature that looks like a spiny turtle, but is in reality "a magician, a sorcerer, a wizard, and a witch all rolled into one...and you can imagine what a dreadful thing that would be." The evil tuxix casts a spell on the children, transforming them into little bird-like beings, with their own heads but the bodies of skylarks. (They resemble the human-headed, bird-bodied sirins, alkonosts, and gamayuns of Russian folklore.) Policeman Bluejay, the force of order in the avian world of the forest, leads the two child-larks on a flight through the sky; he esconces them in an abandoned thrush's nest in a maple tree, and with the help of a friendly eagle he retrieves their picnic basket (so that they don't have to eat bugs, worms, and grubs).
Twinkle and Chubbins learn of their new maple-tree neighbors, a squirrel, an owl, and an o'possum; and Policeman Bluejay introduces them to the community of birds. The children see that the world of living beings in the forest has structure, relationships, and conflict. They hear stories of human cruelty to animals — and soon they witness it firsthand, when hunters enter the forest. The hunters kill Mrs. 'Possum and Mrs. Hootaway and Wisk the squirrel; Twinkle tries to protest, but she can only make a skylark's chirp. The hunters' dog almost catches Twinkle — but she and Chubbins are rescued by their friend the eagle, who swoops down, kills the dog, and leads them to safety.
Or relative safety, at least: the eagle takes the two lark-children up to his eyrie, where his hungry hatchlings want to eat "them" for breakfast. (Baum acknowledges that animals, to survive, have to prey upon each other. Yet he maintains that "love" is the Grand Law of the forest.) Policeman Bluejay escorts the children to a safer location. Soon he takes them to the Paradise of Birds, where the contentions and violence of the forest never penetrate. The children are given a tour of its splendors, and meet the King Bird of Paradise. In the "suburbs" of Paradise, the child-larks are introduced to the community of bees, and meet the Queen Bee; and they witness a spectacular flight of butterflies. 
Beyond Paradise, in "the coarse, outer world," there is trouble in birdland; Policeman Bluejay must cope with a rebellion among the rooks, who would make the other birds their slaves. By uniting, the smaller birds beat the rooks in a battle. The King Bird of Paradise and his Royal Necromancer have told the children that they can restore themselves to human form by eating a fruit called "tingle-berries." They do so, and return to their normal bodies — though Chubbins almost gets stuck halfway. Their adventure done, the children make their way home in the waning light of evening.
The Paradise of Birds.
Baum enriches the text of "Policeman Bluejay" with realistic details of the natural world. Yet Baum was not a naturalist but a fantasist, and the seven chapters (XII — XVIII) that he devotes to the Paradise of Birds are the heart of the fantasy. The author restricts himself to a simple language for his young audience; yet within this simplicity he paints a lush, lustrous, luxuriant prose poem of imaginative effects.
Policeman Bluejay delivers his young charges to the Guardian of the Entrance to Paradise (the Jay himself is too deeply tainted by the outer world to enter). The Guardian accepts them and turns them over to Ephel, the Royal Messenger, who guides them on their tour. Ephel brings them to the royal court of the King Bird of Paradise; the King's lecture on the virtue of vanity is the comic high point of the book. Ephel shows the children the Lustrous Lake with its singing fish, the curious lake of dry water, and the Gleaming Glade where the birds perform their Beauty Dance.
The Paradise of Birds is in fact Eden: "There is a legend that man once lived there, but for some unknown crime was driven away. But the birds have always been allowed to inhabit the place because they did no harm." Since these are "fairy Birds of Paradise," they occupy their own domain of reality; the reader does not need to picture actual Birds of Paradise in an actual American woodland. (Baum's combination of Eden with fairyland raises interesting complexities.)
Baum exploits concepts and images that are used by fantasists before and after him; readers familiar with the genre will perceive echoes of other works. The Paradise of Birds has trees "not made of wood, but having trunks of polished gold and silver and leaves of exquisite metallic colorings" — reminiscent of the gold and silver foliage in "The Twelve Dancing Princesses". The barrier of wind that prevents entrance to the Paradise foreshadows the similar barrier in Lord Dunsany's "The King of Elfland's Daughter". And the flowers with human faces in Chapter XV have a range of parallels.
The form.
Baum's "Policeman Bluejay" partakes of a deep tradition in literature and storytelling, folklore and myth, which employs the animal world, especially birds and bees, as metaphor for the human condition. Chaucer's "The Parliament of Fowls" is probably the best-known work in this vein, though various others can be cited, most commonly involving birds, and in Indian, Persian, and Arabic literature as well as Western. The trope re-appears in twentieth-century poetry, and in the early twenty-first it is still used to reach and teach young children.
In regard to bees, John Day's play "The Parliament of Bees" is arguably the most famous of a number of related works. (One major distinction applies: writers like Chaucer and Day were primarily interested in commenting on human society, and used their animal metaphors as means to that end. In Baum's book, the animals and their welfare are the central consideration.)
More generally, talking animals and human/animal transformation are virtually universal in world folklore. Baum's animal fable participates in this ancient tradition.

USS Wave (SP-1706)

What would have been the third USS "Wave" (SP-1706) was a trawler the United States Navy considered for use as a minesweeper in 1917 and 1918 but which was never actually transferred to the Navy.
"Wave" was a fishing trawler built by the Fore River Shipbuilding Company at Quincy, Massachusetts in 1912 or 1913. Owned by the Bay State Fishing Company, she was inspected by representatives of the Commandant, 1st Naval District, during the spring of 1917. The Navy ordered her delivered for World War I service in June 1917 and again in June 1918, and went so far as to assign her the classification SP-1706 and make plans for her conversion to a minesweeper and assignment to the 1st Naval District. However, the Navy did not actually take her over, and she remained in the hands of her owner and never saw naval service.

Complications of traumatic brain injury

Traumatic brain injury (TBI, physical trauma to the brain) can cause a variety of complications, health effects that are not TBI themselves but that result from it. The risk of complications increases with the severity of the trauma; however even mild traumatic brain injury can result in disabilities that interfere with social interactions, employment, and everyday living. TBI can cause a variety of problems including physical, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral complications.
Effects on consciousness.
Generally, there are six abnormal states of consciousness that can result from a TBI: 
Disorders of consciousness affect a significant number of people who suffer severe TBI; of those with severe TBI discharged from a hospital, 10-15 are in a vegetative state, and of this number only half regain consciousness within one to three years.
Cognitive deficits.
Most patients with severe TBI who recover consciousness suffer from cognitive disabilities, including the loss of many higher-level mental skills. Cognitive deficits that can follow TBI include impaired attention; disrupted insight, judgement, and thought; reduced processing speed; distractibility; and deficits in executive functions such as abstract reasoning, planning, problem-solving, and multitasking. Memory loss, the most common cognitive impairment among head-injured people, occurs in 20–79% of people with closed head trauma, depending on severity. Post-traumatic amnesia (PTA), a confusional state with impaired memory, is characterized by loss of specific memories or the partial inability to form or store new ones.
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disease characterized by dementia, memory loss, and deteriorating cognitive abilities. Research suggests an association between head injury in early adulthood and the development of AD later in life; the more severe the head injury, the greater the risk of developing AD. Some evidence indicates that a head injury may interact with other factors to trigger the disease and may hasten the onset of the disease in individuals already at risk. For example, head-injured people who have a particular form of the protein apolipoprotein E (apoE4, a naturally occurring protein that helps transport cholesterol through the bloodstream) fall into this increased risk category. 
Patients with moderate to severe TBI have more problems with cognitive deficits than do those with mild TBI, but several mild TBIs may have an additive effect. About one in five career boxers is affected by chronic traumatic brain injury (CTBI), which causes cognitive, behavioral, and physical impairments. Dementia pugilistica, also called chronic traumatic encephalopathy, is the severe form of CTBI. Caused by repetitive blows to the head over a long period, the condition primarily affects career boxers. It commonly manifests as dementia, or declining mental ability, memory problems, and parkinsonism (tremors and lack of coordination). Symptoms begin anywhere between 6 and 40 years after the start of a boxing career, with an average onset of about 16 years.
Communication problems.
Language and communication problems are common disabilities in TBI patients. Some may experience aphasia, difficulty with understanding and producing spoken and written language; or they may have difficulty with the more subtle aspects of communication, such as body language and emotional, non-verbal signals. Some may have problems with intonation or inflection, called prosodic dysfunction. Problems with spoken language may occur if the part of the brain that controls speech muscles is damaged. In this disorder, called dysarthria, the patient can think of the appropriate language, but cannot easily speak the words because they are unable to use the muscles needed to form the words and produce the sounds. Speech is often slow, slurred, and garbled.
Sensory deficits.
TBI patients may have sensory problems, especially problems with vision; they may not be able to register what they are seeing or may be slow to recognize objects. Also, TBI patients often have difficulty with hand-eye coordination, causing them to seem clumsy or unsteady. Other sensory deficits include problems with hearing, smell, taste, or touch. Tinnitus, a ringing or roaring in the ears, may occur. A person with damage to the part of the brain that processes taste or smell may perceive a persistent bitter taste or noxious smell. Damage to the part of the brain that controls the sense of touch may cause a TBI patient to develop persistent skin tingling, itching, or pain. These conditions are rare and difficult to treat.
Emotional and behavioral problems.
TBI may cause emotional or behavioral problems and changes in personality. Emotional symptoms that can follow TBI include emotional instability, depression, anxiety, hypomania, mania, apathy, irritability, and anger. TBI appears to predispose a person to psychiatric disorders including obsessive compulsive disorder, alcohol or substance abuse or substance dependence, dysthymia, clinical depression, bipolar disorder, phobias, panic disorder, and schizophrenia. About one quarter of people with TBI suffer from clinical depression, and about 9% suffer mania. The prevalence of all psychiatric illnesses is 49% in moderate to severe TBI and 34% in mild TBI within a year of injury, compared with 18% of controls. People with TBI continue to be at greater risk for psychiatric problems than others even years after an injury. Problems that may persist for up to two years after the injury include irritability, suicidal ideation, insomnia, and loss of the ability to experience pleasure from previously enjoyable experiences.
Behavioral symptoms that can follow TBI include disinhibition, inability to control anger, impulsiveness, lack of initiative, inappropriate sexual activity, and changes in personality. Different behavioral problems are characteristic of the location of injury; for instance, frontal lobe injuries often result in disinhibition and inappropriate or childish behavior, and temporal lobe injuries often cause irritability and aggression.
Physical complications.
Pain, especially headache, is a common complication following a TBI. Being unconscious and lying still for long periods can cause blood clots to form (deep venous thrombosis), which can cause pulmonary embolism. Other serious complications for patients who are unconscious, in a coma, or in a vegetative state include pressure sores, pneumonia or other infections, and progressive multiple organ failure.
The risk of post-traumatic seizures increases with severity of trauma (image at right) and is particularly elevated with certain types of brain trauma such as cerebral contusions or hematomas. As many as 50% of people with penetrating head injuries will develop seizures. People with early seizures, those occurring within a week of injury, have an increased risk of post-traumatic epilepsy (recurrent seizures occurring more than a week after the initial trauma). Generally, medical professionals use anticonvulsant medications to treat seizures in TBI patients within the first week of injury only and after that only if the seizures persist.
Parkinson's disease and other motor problems as a result of TBI are rare but can occur. Parkinson's disease, a chronic and progressive disorder, may develop years after TBI as a result of damage to the basal ganglia. Other movement disorders that may develop after TBI include tremor, ataxia (uncoordinated muscle movements), and myoclonus (shock-like contractions of muscles).
Skull fractures can tear the meninges, the membranes that cover the brain, leading to leaks of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). A tear between the dura and the arachnoid membranes, called a CSF fistula, can cause CSF to leak out of the subarachnoid space into the subdural space; this is called a subdural hygroma. CSF can also leak from the nose and the ear. These tears can also allow bacteria into the cavity, potentially causing infections such as meningitis. Pneumocephalus occurs when air enters the intracranial cavity and becomes trapped in the subarachnoid space. Infections within the intracranial cavity are a dangerous complication of TBI. They may occur outside of the dura mater, below the dura, below the arachnoid (meningitis), or within the brain itself (abscess). Most of these injuries develop within a few weeks of the initial trauma and result from skull fractures or penetrating injuries. Standard treatment involves antibiotics and sometimes surgery to remove the infected tissue. 
Hydrocephalus, post-traumatic ventricular enlargement, occurs when CSF accumulates in the brain, resulting in dilation of the cerebral ventricles and an increase in ICP. This condition can develop during the acute stage of TBI or may not appear until later. Generally it occurs within the first year of the injury and is characterized by worsening neurological outcome, impaired consciousness, behavioral changes, ataxia (lack of coordination or balance), incontinence, or signs of elevated ICP.
Any damage to the head or brain usually results in some damage to the vascular system, which provides blood to the cells of the brain. The body can repair small blood vessels, but damage to larger ones can result in serious complications. Damage to one of the major arteries leading to the brain can cause a stroke, either through bleeding from the artery or through the formation of a blood clot at the site of injury, blocking blood flow to the brain. Blood clots also can develop in other parts of the head. Other types of vascular complications include vasospasm, in which blood vessels constrict and restrict blood flow, and the formation of aneurysms, in which the side of a blood vessel weakens and balloons out.
Fluid and hormonal imbalances can also complicate treatment. Hormonal problems can result from dysfunction of the pituitary, the thyroid, and other glands throughout the body. Two common hormonal complications of TBI are syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone and hypothyroidism.

Johnny Hamp's Kentucky Serenaders

Johnny Hamp's Kentucky Serenaders was an US jazz and dance band, active from the late 1910s through the 1920s. The group was known simply as The Serenaders until Johnny Hamp became the band leader. Johnny Hamp was born in Lancaster, Pennsylvania and should not be confused with British television producer Johnnie Hamp. According to some sources, he became the leader by chance when the band was performing at the Hershey Ballroom in Hershey, Pennsylvania. The band leader at the time had an argument with the players and walked out. Hamp, with no experience as a band leader or conductor, volunteered to lead them for the rest of the evening and they accepted. After the performance, the band asked him to stay on as leader. The "Kentucky" in the name appears to be related to the band's use of "My Old Kentucky Home" as a theme song, rather than any connection to the U.S. state of Kentucky.
The group toured in the eastern United States and toured England in 1930. In 1931, the group was renamed Johnny Hamp and His Orchestra.
The group made most of its recordings in New York City on the Victor label. Their biggest hit was "Black Bottom" recorded in 1926, which led to a dance fad; see Black Bottom (dance).
Hamp continued to record for Victor until April, 1932. The next session was in August, 1935 for ARC (Melotone, Perfect, Romeo, Oriole). In December, 1936, Hamp was back with Victor recording for their Bluebird label for only two sessions (the second in February, 1937), which turned out to be their last session.
Band members at different times included:
Johnny Hamp led other bands in the 1930s and early 1940s ending up as a hotel house band leader in Chicago.

Desk appearance ticket

In New York City, a desk appearance ticket (DAT) is an order to appear in Criminal Court for an arraignment. A person who receives a DAT has been arrested. The DAT is simply one of two alternative means by which a person who is arrested appears for arraignment, or first appearance. A person who receives a DAT is permitted to appear in court on their own on the date indicated on the DAT document. A person who does not receive a DAT is processed through the arrest to arraignment system and is supposed to have their arraignment within 24 hours. From the point that the case is arraigned, a DAT case is like any other criminal case. DATs are usually only issued for misdemeanors in which there is little chance that the defendant will flee the jurisdiction; currently, DATs may be issued for violation, misdemeanors, and "E" felonies. If a person fails to return to court on the date indicated on the DAT, the Court will issue an arrest warrant. 
The authority for a DAT is found in New York's C.P.L §150.10, which describes a DAT as "a written notice issued and subscribed by a police officer... directing a designated person to appear in a designated local criminal court at a designated future time in connection with his alleged commission of a designated offense." 
A person who is eligible for a DAT is not automatically entitled to a DAT. The decision to proceed by way of DAT will always be in the discretion of the police department. During the Giuliani administration, the practice of proceeding by DAT was drastically reduced in favor of sending most cases through the traditional arrest to arraignment system. This was thought to be a way to ensure that those getting DATs did not have outstanding arrest warrants. Since then, the practice of proceeding by way of DAT in eligible cases has risen, but still is not as common as it once was.

Beautiful Gate

According to the Bible, the Beautiful Gate was one of the gates belonging to the Temple in Jerusalem prior to its destruction by the Romans in AD 70. It was referred to as "beautiful" on two occasions in the Acts of the Apostles.
Attempts by scholars to agree on the identity of the gate by one of its recognized names have met with little success although both the upper inner gate, the "Nicanor", and the lower outer gate, the "Shushan", have been suggested as candidates. The Greek adjective used to name the gate ("hōraios") can be defined as '1. happening or coming at the right time —2. beautiful, fair, lovely'. Some scholars believe the word may refer more to ripeness than to beauty.

Hong Kong Morris

The Hong Kong Morris (Chinese: 香港古代英國舞 團, Cantonese pronunciation: "Heung Gong Gwoo Doi Ying Gwok Mo Tuen", literally Hong Kong Ancient English Dance Platoon) is an English morris dancing side founded in Hong Kong in 1974. The side now has two chapters, the Hong Kong Morris in Hong Kong and the Hong Kong (UK) Morris, colloquially known as The Brackets, in the United Kingdom. In its heyday, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Hong Kong Morris was one of the largest Cotswold morris sides in the world. The side is committed to the principles of multiculturalism and inclusivity, and has always encouraged a multicultural membership and mixed dancing. The return of the former British colony of Hong Kong to China in 1997 has had no effect on the side's activities, and it continues to flourish as a notable example of the resilience of Western cultural activity in postcolonial Hong Kong.
Early history.
The Hong Kong Morris was founded by Jim Carter in 1974. Many of its early members were officers of the Royal Hong Kong Police Force. One founding member, Tony Reynolds, was a Quaker who had driven ambulances along the Burma Road during the Second World War. The side met to practice at St John’s Cathedral in Garden Road, Hong Kong Island. In the 1980s the side attracted British expatriates working in Hong Kong, teachers and engineers being particularly well represented. The side’s numbers reached a peak in the mid-1980s, at around 50 dancers and musicians.
Due to the increase in the team's numbers the practice venue was moved in the early 1980s to South Island School. In 1985 the side was featured in the Morris Ring publication "The Morris Tradition", as an example of the spread of morris dancing beyond its traditional home in England. 
Notable events.
The side has typically danced either at open-air venues in Hong Kong such as fetes and festivals or in air-conditioned shopping malls. During the mid-1980s the Hong Kong Morris performed on most weekends, though in recent years performances have been less frequent.
In 1987 the side danced on top of a decorated shipping container swung out over Kwai Chung Creek on a crane to mark the opening of a new berth at Kwai Chung Container Terminals.
In 1988, in order to benefit from the waiver of fees granted by the Urban Council to charitable, religious and educational groups for the use of its premises, the Hong Kong Morris successfully argued that it was a religious group on the grounds that morris dancing was a survival of a pre-Christian fertility rite. This myth was exploded with the publication in 1999 of "A History of Morris Dancing", John Forrest's magisterial study of the historical roots of morris dancing (no earlier than the fifteenth century), and is no longer an argument that the side could make with a good conscience.
In 1990 and 1991 three four-person teams from the Hong Kong Morris took part in the annual Trailwalker competition, an event that involves walking the 100 kilometres of the Maclehose Trail within a period of 48 hours. On both occasions the walkers changed into morris kit near the end of the trail, danced across the finishing line, and took part in a vigorous display of morris dancing afterwards. 
In 1991 the side danced at Hei Ling Chau refugee camp. Its audience consisted of several hundred Vietnamese boat people who had fled from Vietnam and had been interned upon their arrival in Hong Kong.
In 1994 the side celebrated its twentieth anniversary in Hong Kong. A large number of former members returned to Hong Kong from the UK and Canada to take part in the celebrations.
In 1997, shortly before the handover of Hong Kong to China, the Hong Kong Morris held The Last Ale of the Empire.
In 2004 the side celebrated its thirtieth anniversary. Again, several former members returned to Hong Kong for the anniversary. The celebrations included dancing in Hong Kong Park, in Stanley, and outside the Cultural Centre in Tsim Sha Tsui.
In 2008 and 2009 the Hong Kong Morris celebrated May Morning by dancing next to the Wishing Tree in San Uk Tsai, a locally-celebrated banyan tree believed to bring good fortune to its devotees.
The Brackets.
In 1984 China and the United Kingdom issued a Joint Declaration providing for the return of Hong Kong to China in 1997. In the late 1980s, largely due to localisation policies implemented in preparation for the 1997 handover, many of the side’s members returned to the United Kingdom. These members met for a weekend of dance at Wimborne, Dorset in 1991, at which the decision was taken to form the Hong Kong (UK) Morris, colloquially known as The Brackets. Initial Brackets gatherings took place at the annual Sidmouth Folk Festival in Devon, normally held at the end of July. In January 1993 a recently returned Hong Kong Morris member organised a weekend of dance for The Brackets and the Brackley Morris Men in Northamptonshire. The idea of a January gathering in addition to the July Sidmouth reunion caught on, and The Brackets now regularly meet and dance together in the first week of January as well as at Sidmouth.
Many of the Brackets became members of local morris sides after their return to the UK, but all retain an allegiance to the Hong Kong Morris. Throughout the 1990s members of the Hong Kong and UK sides met up annually at the Sidmouth Folk Festival, and links between the two sides remain strong. Many members of The Brackets returned to Hong Kong in 1994 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the foundation of the Hong Kong Morris, and several Brackets members also helped to celebrate the side's 30th anniversary in 2004.
A strong side of Brackets visited Hong Kong in October 2008, and the local and UK sides danced together in Stanley, on Lamma Island and in Macau.
Constitution and offices.
The Hong Kong Morris is registered under the Societies Ordinance (Cap. 151 of the Laws of Hong Kong), a local ordinance introduced by the Hong Kong Government to counter the threat of subversion. The ordinance allows the government to monitor the activities of political parties, pressure groups and other potentially-undesirable combinations, and under its provisions the side is required to furnish the government every year with copies of its accounts and the minutes of its annual general meeting.
As with many other morris sides, the officers of the Hong Kong Morris include a squire (president), a bagman (treasurer) and a foreman (dance teacher). In 1989, in recognition of the wish of the women members to develop their own dance traditions, the office of foreman was replaced with a men's foreman and a women's foreman.
Costume.
The men's side of the Hong Kong Morris wear white trousers and shirts. Their baldricks, red and yellow with green highlights, are decorated with a badge representing a Chinese dragon behind a rapper sword knot. All three colours, but particularly red, are considered lucky in Chinese tradition, and drew attention away from the men's white shirts and trousers. White is the colour worn at funerals in China, and is considered inauspicious. This costume was lightly modified in 1984.
The Hong Kong Morris colour palette (red, yellow and green) influenced the costume of the Vancouver Morris Men [http://vancouvermorrismen.org/], one of Canada's most illustrious morris sides. Graham Baldwin, one of the earliest members of the Hong Kong Morris, founded the Vancouver Morris Men in 1982, and chose the same colours for the costume of the Vancouver side.
The costume of the Hong Kong Morris women's side has undergone changes over the years. The first women's costume consisted of a white blouse and a skirt available in light green, russet brown, or pink. In 1984 this early costume was replaced with a uniform costume designed by Annette Frizell, consisting of a red skirt, a white blouse and a green waistcoat. At present many of the women dancers continue to wear the costume introduced in 1984, though some dancers prefer a modified open-neck version of the 1984-model white blouse. Other dancers wear the same costume as the men.
The sticks used by the side in its dances are wrapped in tape in three broad bands of colour: red, white and green. The green end of the stick is always held uppermost, so that any blood shed in an incautious stick clash is disguised by dripping onto the lower red band.
Many morris sides include one or more members dressed as animals, typically horses. The Hong Kong Morris has its own hobby horse named Horace, normally represented by Martin Samson.
Dancing traditions.
Most of the dances performed by the Hong Kong Morris are from the Cotswold Morris tradition. Cotswold traditions danced at various periods in the side’s history include Adderbury, Ascot-under-Wychwood, Bampton, Bledington, Bucknell, Fieldtown, Headington, Lichfield, Stanton Harcourt and Upton-on-Severn. At periods in its history the side has also performed longsword dances, garland dances, rapper dances and mumming plays.
While the Hong Kong Morris has always regarded Lionel Bacon's classic work "A Handbook of Morris Dances" as a most valuable source of information on the form and historical development of particular morris tunes and morris dances, it has never felt the need to adhere slavishly to the particular form in which a dance or tune was collected several decades ago. The side has therefore contributed to the development of the morris tradition by adapting a number of existing dances to local circumstances. In the early 1980s the Hong Kong Morris developed a variant of the Lichfield Morris tradition, designed to be viewed from above when being danced on the circular ground-floor stage of the multi-storey shopping mall The Landmark. Instead of the conventional set of eight dancers, the Hong Kong Morris danced Lichfield with twelve dancers arranged in a cross formation. This formation enabled spectacular effects to be achieved, particularly in the complex Lichfield Hey. Other dances similarly adapted include the Upton-on-Yangtze stick dance, a version of the Upton-on-Severn stick dance performed in traditional Chinese costume with chopsticks, and Governor's Gallop, a dance developed in the early 1990s in honour of Chris Patten, Hong Kong's last British governor.
Music.
The main musicians for the Hong Kong side are Sue Ellis and Sue Papper (melodeons), and for the Brackets Steve Butler/Hall, John Bacon (both piano accordions), John Rowlands (button accordion) and June Rowlands (fiddle). The squeezebox and fiddle players normally carry the main burden of the tune, while attractive decorative effects are produced by supporting musicians with less powerful instruments. Bill Crump and Dave Ellis, for example, use the tin whistle to counterpoint and harmonise with the main melody. While most of the side's musicians play traditional morris instruments (the piano accordion, the button accordion, the melodeon, the concertina, the fiddle, the guitar, the bodhran and the tin whistle), the Hong Kong Morris has never refused less conventional instruments. The late Mike Cowley's inimitable performance on the trombone (Mike died on 18 November 2010) will be particularly missed, as it gave the side’s music a depth and volume that considerably enhanced the performance of the dancers and at times reduced them to tears of laughter.
Mumming play and rapper dancing.
The Hong Kong Morris has for many years performed an English mumming play. Texts of a large number of medieval mumming plays have survived, and the play performed by the side is in the mainstream mumming play tradition. It contains the characters Father Christmas, Saint George and the Turkish Knight. In the late 1980s and early 1990s the mumming play actors also included a display of rapper sword dancing in their performance. The impact of these performances was considerably enhanced by the striking costumes produced for the actors by side member Chris Baldwin, a devotee of amateur dramatics.
Singing.
Singing (mostly of English folk songs) has always played a role in the apres-morris conviviality of the Hong Kong Morris. Jim Carter, Hilary Blythe and Phil Pimentil, three of the side's early members, were noted singers on the local folk scene as part of the group Mulled Ale, and launched a tradition of powerful singing. Several other regular singers have maintained this tradition, including Mary Read and Amy Hughes (romantic ballads), Mike Greenhalgh (sea shanties), Dave Wilmshurst ('Death to the French' songs), Steve Ford (folksong parodies) and Dave Ellis (drinking songs). Kyoko Fukuda has recently widened the side's singing repertoire with two songs sung in Japanese: one about an elephant, known as The Elephant Song, and one about something else, known jokingly as The Not-the-Elephant Song.
Phil Pimentil used to sing one of the few English folksongs known to have mentioned Hong Kong, about an Irish navvy who found work in the British colony in the late nineteenth century: 'I'm off to be a Chinaman, to Hong Kong I'm bound.' Another song with a China connection, "The Chinese Bumboatman Song", also known as "The Ballad of Wing Chang Loo", has become a side favourite, and is sometimes delivered with 'an horrible oath' (as the song requires) in Cantonese, depending on the company.
Oratory.
An important aspect of any morris side's performance is rapport with its audience, and good speakers can make all the difference to a side's reception. The late Jim Carter was one of the side's most effective orators in its early days, and his baton has been passed on to Roger Pope, who brings to his task the humour and gravitas won in his chosen career as a school headmaster. When dancing for Chinese audiences in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Morris always tries to make its announcements in Cantonese. Several of its expatriate members have enough Cantonese to make themselves understood on such occasions.
Inclusivity and multiculturalism.
The Hong Kong Morris attracted its first women members in the late 1970s, at a time when there was opposition to women’s morris dancing in the United Kingdom. Women and men have always danced together in the Hong Kong Morris, either in mixed sets or in separate sets. By the mid-1980s the side’s growing numbers enabled strong men’s and women’s sets to develop, and each set began to specialise in certain Cotswold traditions, while retaining a large common core of dances for mixed dancing. In 1989 a women’s foreman was added to the side’s officers. The Hong Kong Morris was briefly a member side of the Morris Ring, but was asked to leave the Ring because of its inclusive policy on women’s dancing. It is now a member side of the Morris Federation. Two of its members, John Bacon and Chris Butler/Hall, have played an influential role respectively in the development of the policies of the Morris Federation and Open Morris, two organisations in the United Kingdom committed to the principle of mixed dancing.
The side has also welcomed dancers and musicians of all nationalities. Although most of its members have been English, it has also had Hong Kong Chinese, Scottish, American, Australian, New Zealand, French, South African, Thai, Ukrainian and Japanese members.
Invention of traditions.
A number of traditions were invented by the Hong Kong Morris in the early 1980s, some of which have survived. These include an adaptation of the Oxford custom May Morning, a ritual that includes dancing on The Peak at dawn followed by a hearty breakfast and still more dancing; Macau trips, including evenings of singing and dancing at the Pousada da Coloane hotel and lunch at Fernando's restaurant on Hac Sa Beach; junk trips to the Lamma Island Wan Kee Seafood Restaurant; Boxing Day dancing; and a send-off 'ale' for departing members of the side.
Overseas tours.
The first overseas tour by the Hong Kong Morris was to Manila in 1980. In 1984 a strong Hong Kong Morris side visited Perth (Australia) and danced with the local ladies' side The Fair Maids of Perth.
Subsequent tours have included the 1986 Guangzhou Tour, the 1987 North American Tour to Seattle, Victoria and Vancouver (a tour in which the side danced with the US sides MossyBacks and Misty City and the Canadian Victoria and Vancouver Morris sides); the 1988 Brisbane Tour to Maleny Folk Festival, at which the side's musician was asked to accompany an Australian women's side of practising witches; the 1989 Taiwan Tour, whose participants enjoyed the unfamiliar experience of being cultural ambassadors for British education; the 1990 Bangkok Tour; the 1995 Kuala Lumpur Tour, which doubled as a honeymoon for recently married Steve and Myra Ford; and the 1997 Canberra Tour, where the Hong Kong Morris provided a visual history of morris dancing as a specially-invited side, performed its mumming play and led a session of chorus singing.
Visits to Hong Kong by overseas sides.
The Hong Kong Morris is the only morris side in Hong Kong, and has therefore welcomed visits from other morris sides. Teams that have danced in Hong Kong as guests of the Hong Kong Morris include the Australian side The Fair Maids of Perth (1985, in return for the 1984 Perth Tour), the American sides MossyBack Morris Men and Misty City (1988, in return for the 1987 North American Tour), and the UK clog dancing side Kettle Bridge Clogs (1989).
Several former members of the Hong Kong Morris now dance with other sides, and occasionally revisit their old haunts. Peter and Christine Baldwin, now with the Cyprus Morris, danced with the Hong Kong Morris in November 2010 in the village of Tai Hang in the Lam Tsuen valley.

Soils.
The soils of the area can be broadly classified as
Latosols: Soils formed due to lateralization are called as ‘Latosols’ or ‘Latosolic soils’. This will have local accumulation of ‘iron’ and ‘alumina’ pockets. In fact, it is the iron rich pockets that contribute to the building material. This becomes hard and compact on exposure to drying. A thin regolith forms on the laterite.

About Last Night... (South Park)

"About Last Night…" is the twelfth episode of the twelfth season of the animated series "South Park", and the 179th episode of the series overall. The episode was first broadcast on Wednesday, November 5, 2008 at 10:00 PM EST, less than a day after Barack Obama was declared the winner in the 2008 presidential election. Excerpts from speeches given by Obama and John McCain the night before are included in the episode. In the episode, Obama wins the 2008 Presidential Election, setting off mass uncontrollable partying by Obama supporters and driving McCain supporters to desperation and suicide, a guise of chaos that serves as misdirection for the presidential candidates to set off their true plot: an intricately planned jewel heist.
The episode was written and directed by series co-creator Trey Parker, and was rated TV-MA L in the United States. The episode parodies heist movies, in particular the "Ocean's Trilogy".
Plot.
Following the announcement of the 2008 presidential election results, Barack Obama (Trey Parker) and John McCain (Matt Stone) address their supporters on nationwide TV as the South Park townspeople gather to watch. Randy and the other Obama supporters (including the Marshes and Broflovskis, except for Ike, who supported McCain) celebrate drunkenly in the streets, while McCain supporters (including the Stotches, Mr. Garrison and Mr. Mackey) sit despondently inside, fearing that the new, inexperienced president would lead to the end of civilization. Ike attempts suicide by jumping out a first-story window; he survives but appears to be badly injured, so Stan and Kyle try to take him to the hospital. The two boys search through the partying crowd to find anyone who can drive Ike to the hospital, but without success. Randy, believing that Obama's win means he will be financially secure forever, insults and punches his boss (also an Obama supporter) in the face, breaking his nose. Other revelers tip over Officer Barbrady's police car when he tries to restore order.
Stan and Kyle find the Stotches building an "ark" while keeping many of the McCain supporters back since there's no more room. The boys' plea for help leads to a brawl among the adults, so they head for the hospital on foot. The emergency room is packed with patients who have either partied too hard or tried to kill themselves to the point that the hospital nurse (who is alone because one doctor was partying and one hanged himself) can determine what has happened to Ike by simply asking which candidate he supported. Randy is found here as well, trying to still party while singing Barry Manilow's "Mandy" (replacing "Oh, Mandy" with "Obama").
The subplot of the episode is where Obama and McCain turns out to be jewel thief leaders of a heist club known as the "Presidential Crime Syndicate" and staged the entire election so that one of them could gain access to the Oval Office. This was to access a tunnel that would lead to the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History, where they would steal the Hope Diamond. They were able to accomplish the mission with the help of Michelle Obama, a computer hacker who had also faked her marriage with Obama to fool the press, and Sarah Palin, who is not only secretly English, but actually more intelligent than the episode's original portrayal of her would suggest (she says to a bewildered press corps that she'll come back and beat Obama in 2009, then leaves saying "Oh, my phone's goin' ringy!"). Once the plan was complete, Ike, who had been a member of the heist the entire time, blows up a private jet that contained dummies of the criminals and alters hospital records to declare everyone involved legally dead. The next day, as the gang is at Dulles Airport about to leave the country, Obama decides that he does not want to go with them. Instead, he and his wife decide to stay behind to "give this President thing a shot."
At the end of the episode, the McCain supporters emerge from their "ark" to find that society has not collapsed overnight. They eventually realise that they have overreacted to the election's results and decide to give President Obama a chance (rationalizing that if he is a bad president that they could just vote him out in four years). As for Randy, he wakes up on his couch with a hangover to find that his pants are missing and his TV is gone (Cartman had stolen it, having taken advantage of the chaos to steal TVs from people's houses and was selling them from a cart strapped to his Big Wheel earlier in the episode). Stan then walks in and tells Randy that he has been fired. Not realizing it was for insulting and punching his boss (and saying he did not need the job anymore now that Obama was elected), Randy scowls and exclaims "Goddamnit! Obama said things would be different! That son of a bitch lied to us! I knew I should've voted for McCain!"
Production.
According to interviews with Matt Stone and Trey Parker, this was the only version of the episode produced, as a McCain version proved "too daunting a task". The overreaction of supporters of both Obama and McCain informed the episode's content. The episode was completed the morning of the day it was broadcast, with Comedy Central seeing only excerpts of the show beforehand. The heist plot was chosen because it was neutral with respect to who won the election, though the plot depicted Obama winning because the creators felt in the final weeks before the election that Obama would win. The scenes depicting the victory and concession speeches were animated with generic speech filler in the place of lines from the actual speeches and the backdrops behind the candidates that would be added after the real Obama and McCain gave their actual speeches, though Stone expressed amazement at how the filler they wrote matched the content of the actual speeches later heard on Election Night. The animators stated that they used a temporary lip-sync animation because of time constraints. The creators explained that had McCain won, they would've dealt with their own "Dewey Defeats Truman" situation at a later time, perhaps redubbing lines in which characters mention the election results, purposely doing it badly in the style of "Mystery Science Theater 3000". Stone also explained some of the rationale behind deciding which characters would be depicted supporting which candidate, though he admitted that some of these choices were arbitrary.

Leigh Hobbs

Leigh Hobbs is an Australian artist and author.
Although he works across a wide range of mediums, he is best known in Australia and the United Kingdom for the humorous children’s books he has written and illustrated. These feature his characters "Old Tom", "Horrible Harriet", "Fiona the Pig", "Mr Badger" and "Mr Chicken". Plus the characters in the "4F for FREAKS" books.
Life and career.
Leigh Hobbs was born in Williamstown, a suburb of Melbourne, in Victoria, Australia but grew up in the Victorian country town of Bairnsdale.
After graduating from art school (Caulfield Institute of Technology - now Monash University) in 1973, his first job - at age 21 - was at Sydney’s Luna Park, an amusement park next to the Sydney Harbour Bridge, where he worked as an artist.
His initial task was to design the colour scheme for an antique carousel. However, during his time at the park he also created two large three-dimensional characters called "Larry" and "Lizzy Luna", which now reside at Sydney’s Powerhouse Museum.
For a major part of his working life Hobbs supported himself primarily by working as a secondary school art teacher, 1978 -2002.
In 1980 Hobbs had a one man show of his caricature sculptures at the Rex Irwin Gallery in Sydney.
Between 1985 - 2010 Hobbs was a freelance contributing cartoonist for the Melbourne "The Age" newspaper. During this time The Age published a number of major profiles of Hobbs and his work.
These were on March 27, 1999, July 7, 2001, June 19, 2002, May 24, 2003 and March 24, 2007.

Bibliography.
The following books were written and illustrated by Leigh Hobbs:
Leigh Hobbs’s children's books are often described as working on a number of levels and could be seen as gently subversive. For example, Hobbs's most popular creation, "Old Tom", is a grotesque one eyed cat, but the word cat is never used in the books. Old Tom's 'owner' a prim matron like character called Angela Throgmorton thinks of Old Tom as her 'son' and the stories revolve around her efforts to socialise this creature who is in fact like a seven year old boy trying to break free of a mothers constraints.

Saint Matthew's Episcopal Day School

Saint Matthew's Episcopal Day School is a private co-educational day school located in San Mateo, California. It was founded in 1953 and was previously a military school known as Saint Matthew's Hall or Saint Matthew's School.
History.
On April 24, 1864, Giles Alexander Easton established an Episcopal church named for Saint Matthew on the historic mission trail known as El Camino Real. Services were held in a school until ground could be broken for a building. Two acres of land were donated by Agnes Poett Howard, widow of William Davis Merry Howard, and their son, William Henry Howard. 
In 1865 a stone church with capacity of about 200 people was built and a two-story school building known as Saint Mathew's Hall for the school. The nave was by , and the chancel was by . The street between the church and school was known as Saint Matthews Avenue. Alfred Lee Brewer (1831–1899) operated the school in English "public school" tradition with strict military discipline. In 1882 the school was moved to an site, with about 120 boys enrolled. The school campus became part of the city of Burlingame, California.
Three Princes of the Kingdom of Hawaii, brothers Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole (1871–1922), David Kawānanakoa (1868–1908) and Edward Keliʻiahonui (1869–1887) attended the school in the 1880s. 
It advertised itself as "the leading private educational institution for boys on the Pacific Coast" in 1889. It was later taken over by his son William Augustus Brewer (1863–1931).
William Brewer became mayor of the new town of Hillsborough, California.
By 1902 the school was called "the best known private educational institution upon the west coast."

Harvey Fellows

Harvey Winson Fellows (11 April 1826 in Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire – 13 January 1907 in Rickmansworth) was an English amateur cricketer. He was the brother of Walter Fellows.
Career.
Fellows was a right-handed batsman and a roundarm right arm fast bowler. Having made his name as a schoolboy cricketer at Eton College, where he bowled in tandem with Walter Marcon in 1841 and 1842, Fellows was mainly associated with Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). He played for several predominantly amateur teams, including I Zingari, and represented the Gentlemen in the Gentlemen v Players series.
Fellows was noted for his fearsome pace, especially on rough pitches. He is said to have reached his peak early and, after he changed his action by raising the height of his arm during delivery, he lost much of his speed and accuracy. 
Fellows made 67 known appearances in first-class matches from 1847 to 1869. His known career bowling record includes a total of 169 wickets at an average of 7.66 with a best performance of 8 wickets in one innings. He is credited with ten wickets in a match on 7 occasions.

Palisades Toys

Palisades Entertainment, LLC, better known as Palisades Toys, was a manufacturing and distributing toy & collectibles company geared toward the adult collector market. Established in 1994, the company generally worked within the same vein as competitors such as McFarlane Toys and NECA, producing detailed action figures, statues, plushes, and other collectibles of licensed properties until its bankruptcy in 2006. Palisades also developed the brand Factory X which continues under Limited by CAS Inc. In its heyday, Palisades was widely regarded a favorite company of serious toy collectors for its outstanding dedication to quality and consumers as well as its genuine passion for collectibles.
Public relations and products.
Palisades was notable for its close relationship and commonality with toy fans. The official message board served as one of the company's strongest communication platforms where President and CEO Mike Horn and other employees would directly discuss their products with consumers. In fact, polls were often held to let fans decide upcoming products, and news coverage of the company frequently stemmed from Palisades' forum discussion. Horn and his wife, Kate, were also reachable through the buyer's office. The company's concern with adequate distribution of merchandise forced it to introduce Palisades Collector's Club. This offered exclusive figures and came in response to reports of difficulty in obtaining the Vanishing Cream Beaker figure.
In terms of product quality, Palisades set high standards, particularly with its array of action figures. Such attributes included strong attention to detail and likeness, a high rate of joint articulation and bountiful accessories with tedious working functions. The company frequently employed designers from the fan community of each property they licensed and always credited staff and contributors on packages. Palisades also assigned help from various groups such as the painting and sculpting talents of Plan B Toys and accessory work by Industrial Zoo. "The Muppet Show" collection, celebrating its 25th anniversary, would become one of Palisades' flagship licenses. The line lasted nine series through 2001-2005 and included various convention and store exclusive figures as well as expansive playset. Aside from the aforementioned qualities, it also boasted an innovative technique in which a magnet placed inside the figure's head would allow its magnetically equipped hat to sit firmly in place.
In 2001, Palisades acquired the license to produce "" figures to commemorate its 35th anniversary. Concept designs were soon being developed and aimed for a style similar to the Playmates' previous "Star Trek" line. However, despite such comprehensive plans, the figures were never produced.
In 2003, Fun 4 All unveiled plans to produce "Sesame Street" action figures but had only developed prototypes before its bankruptcy in mid-2004. A few months later, Palisades obtained the hot license. The debut of this collection was culminated by the 2005 convention exclusive Super Grover with box art by Alex Ross. As one of the most highly anticipated figure lines at the time, the first series of "Sesame Street" was intended for a mid-2005 release but came to a stirring delay. In fact, two series of figures were planned, and many photos of the fully developed, packaged figure prototypes were released to the public. But the line would ultimately never come to fruition, according to Horn, due to lack of retailer support. This same problem haunted "The Muppet Show" and led to its cancellation that same year.
Distribution.
Palisades products were sold throughout the world at various retail outlets including Toys R Us, KB Toys, Target, Electronics Boutique, Tower Records, Media Play, Sam Goody, Suncoast Video, and various comic shops. Due to the selectivity of the company's products, however, this range of retailers would eventually narrow to a select few and play a significant part in Palisades' floundering success.
On August 1, 2005, Palisades began a partnership with Blister Direct that made them the exclusive distributor of Palisades merchandise in Japan. On September 18, Diamond Comics Distributors became Palisades' sole distributor of North America.
Financial trouble and bankruptcy.
While generally praised by the toy community, Palisades' uncompromising devotion to adult collectors proved financially cumbersome. Many products laid within a narrow niche market of passionate fans or were simply unusual in scale or design; an example would be Mega Meatwad, a 5½" tall, non-articulated figure of the simple, limbless character. Yet comprehensive quality and large supply were being exerted on such selective merchandise. Despite such a staggering level of production, Palisades' also offered some of its merchandise at considerably low prices compared to similar high-end products within the industry. A combination of these factors may have attributed to deep expense on behalf of the acclaimed toy company.
Micronauts dilemma.
The biggest blow to Palisades, however, would be during the production of "Micronauts", Series 1. The company initially was given the impression that it would have access to the original "Micronauts" molds and tooling which would reduce production effort. This would not be the case, however, and plans were scaled back as everything would have to be built from scratch. Curiously, Takara would have no part in this "Micronauts" revival, so Palisades began seeking out vintage samples from fans to help its development.
Throughout mid-late 2002, according to former Palisades toy designer Bryan Wilkinson, reports from China on the in-development line were positive. However, it would later be discovered that Ken Lilly, who was head of Palisades’ product development, had been deceived by a company acting as Palisades' middleman responsible for subcontracting the factory. By this point, a significant percentage of the commission was paid to the middleman, and the other portion was to be paid after contract fulfillment. This middleman apparently had no intention of ever collecting the rest, and instead, kept most of the money while farming out the production to another facility to develop the toys for a fraction of the cost and with no quality control. The middleman never received the rest of its money and vanished when pursued by Palisades.
With numerous errors and mispackaged and defective parts, employees were appalled at the result, but at this stage, financial losses on the part of Palisades would be inevitable. Not only was the "Micronauts" line affected, but other lines assigned to the factory at the time, such as part of the early "The Muppet Show" series, suffered though not as heavily.
Adding to the strain was slow shipment due to the U.S. dock workers' union dispute and lockout in October 2002. Already over-budget Palisades quickly addressed the poor quality but had few resorts and only one employee to handle it. The company could only replace badly damaged returned toys with other poor quality product which, according to Wilkinson, "might have been their worst mistake from a public relations point of view, as some felt that this indicated they were trying to still push and mark up known defective product." Nevertheless, while financial recovery would be impossible, Palisades attempted to salvage their reputation and pride with a second "Micronauts" series, a retooled Series 1, and a special Series 1.5, working more closely with the manufacturers this time. However, the company lost even more money in doing so, and retailers lost interest. A third series was put in development as a last attempt at redemption but canceled. The "Micronauts" revival would result in "an albatross for Palisades, their biggest financial loss ever."
Cancellations and demise.
Problems with Palisades became evident as early as mid-2005. A forum poll the prior year let fans choose a "Muppet" pack-in character or accessory. However, due to a growing retailer disinterest in the line, the winning item, which was a cow, would not be released. Later that year, "The Muppet Show" was canceled entirely, after which Ken Lilly had posted the tentative series 10 through 14 lineup on their message board. Four items of the series were released while all of the rest never passed the prototype or planning stages. These consisted of basic, Mega, and Mini figures, in addition to playsets such as the massive Muppet Theater.
In November, a press release by President Mike Horn detailed the long-standing delay on Palisades' hotly anticipated "Sesame Street" action figure line:
News from the company became scarce in the following months, and it was reported that shortly before Christmas, a large number of key staff members were released. Palisades also did not appear at the 2005 Wizard World Dallas, 2006 UK ToyFair, or 2006 US ToyFair where they would typically have had a significant presence. 
Finally, on February 1, 2006, Palisades announced its bankruptcy and subsequent sale of the company to Limited by CAS Inc. Horn discussed the situation in a press release noting, "This development parallels a general trend within the toy industry, including the bankruptcy of one of Palisades’ largest customers." While Limited continued Palisades' Factory X branch of statues and prop replicas, Horn and his wife were not offered positions in the transaction.
Aside from "Sesame Street", the sudden disestablishment of Palisades had left several other planned products left unreleased. Those who bought the first series of "Aqua Teen Hunger Force" figures, for example, would not be able to complete their set with the second series intended for a February 2006 release.
Post-Palisades.
According to his LinkedIn profile, former Palisades president Michael Horn became president of SwagDog, an apparel company, in May 2007 as well as CEO of MVP Collection, a collectibles company, in April 2008. His wife, Kate, served as client advisor to Russel BMW from 2006-2008 and has been director of operations for SwagDog since 2009.
In 2006, Ken Lilly founded Creatus Maximus. As of 2010, however, his LinkedIn profile lists him as freelance product development and design for the company.
Greg Leeuwen, a former art director for Palisades, has since become the graphic and interactive designer at Crosby Marketing Communications. 
Phil Reasoner, who created image guides for Palisades went on to become the primary image guide supplier for GentleGiantCollectors.com.

The A7 was the team's first time running a turbocharged engine. This was the same powerful BMW M12 Straight 4 which was also used by the Brabham team, though unlike Brabham who had BMW engineers looking after their engines, the Arrows engines were maintained and developed by Swiss engine guru Heini Mader.

The A8 placed 8th in the 1985 Constructors' Championship on 14 points which included a podium finish for Thierry Boutsen at Imola where he placed 3rd but was later moved to 2nd when winner Alain Prost's McLaren was disqualified for being underweight. This proved to be the A8's high point as it was never again driven to a podium finish.
Arrows and the aging A8 could only place 10th in the Constructors' Championship final standings in 1986 with Christian Danner scoring a point for 6th place at the 1986 Austrian Grand Prix.
While Heini Mader did a good job in maintaining the team's BMW engines, they lacked the power of the same engines powering the Brabham and later Benetton teams as those particular engines were continually maintained by BMW, giving them access to new parts, information and factory backed development that Mader did not have. This was shown in the results as the Arrows-BMWs rarely out-qualified or out-raced the Brabhams or Benettons.

Arrows A2

The Arrows A2 was a Formula One racing car used by the Arrows team in the latter half of the 1979 Formula One season. Like most Formula One cars at the time, the A2 ran with ground effect aerodynamics and thus had no need of a traditional front wing. However, unlike most contemporary cars, its engine was set with a four-degree angle.
The A2 generated extensive downforce, but at the expense of handling. The car was hard to steer through corners, and suffered from porpoising on the straights. Within weeks design work started on the A2's successor, the A3, and the A1 was brought back for the second half of the 1979 season.

Type 63A

The Type 63A (; also known as the ZTS63A) is an Amphibious light tank upgraded from the Type 63, designed for river-crossing operations at inland rivers and lakes. Its industrial designation is WZ213.
Development.
Before the mid-1990s, Chinese ground forces relied on the Type 63 amphibious light tank developed in the early 1960s. The low swimming speed and weak firepower of the Type 63 was insufficient to the needs of modern maritime amphibious assault operations that PLA would conduct. The PLA demanded a replacement for the Type 63 in the early 1990s, which led to the development of the Type 63A in 1997. Reports indicate that over 300 examples has been delivered to the PLA by the end of 2000.
Design.
The Type 63A is lightly armoured amphibious light tank with a flat, boat-like hull. Suspension is made up of 6 road wheels and lead or return rollers. A redesigned welded turret from the original Type 63 is mounted center of the hull, with the powerpack positioned in the rear. The Type 63A has 2 additional floating tanks to increase the stability of the vehicle in the water. There are 3 water inlets on both sides of the hull. In the rear of the hull there are to allow 2 large water jets for travelling in water.
Type 63A introduces an enlarged welded turret replacing the original Type 63 turret, the modernised Type 63A utilises the dual-way stabilised 105 mm rifled gun replacining the 85 mm gun. The 105 mm rifled gun, fires armour piercing fin stabilised discarding sabot (APFSDS), high explosive (HE), and high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) ammunitions, with 45 rounds carried inside the vehicle. APFSDS round penetrates 650 mm steel armour or destroy a reinforced concrete bunker a distance of 2,000 m.
To overcome the inaccuracy of firing when swimming, the Type 63A uses laser-beam guidance ATGM which isn't affected by the wave motions while swimming. The missile has a maximum firing range of 4–5 km with a first hit probability of +90% against stationary targets. Its secondary functions can engage low-flying helicopters.
Performance.
The Type 63A enhance capability allows the vehicle to conduct amphibious operations from its host amphibious warfare ships at distances from 5–7 km to shore at a speed of 28 km/h. 
Compared to the Type 63, the Type 63A featured five major improvements:
The modernised Type 63 to Type 63A has given enhanced sea travelling performance, increased swimming speed, improved fire-control system, ATGM capability, and larger 105 mm rifled gun with dual stabilizers.
System.
The FCS includes digital fire-control computer, integrated commander sight with laser rangefinder input, and white-light spotter or image-stabilised gunner's sight w/ passive night vision. The Type 63A night vision is an image intensifier system. Alternatively the gunner sight can be fitted with a thermal imager night vision. It is also equipped with the satellite positioning (GPS/GLONASS) system to allow accurate landing position in harsh weather conditions and night operations. It's also equipped with computerised fire-control to enable accurate firing both on land and at sea.

Arrows A9

The Arrows A9 was a Formula One car which the Arrows team used to compete in the 1986 Formula One season. It was powered by the BMW M12 Tubocharged engine.
The A9 was supposed to replace the ageing A8 car, but it turned out the be worse than its predecessor.
Because of this the team stuck with the A8 from the previous season. As a result, the A9 only saw action at three races, at the German and Austrian Grands Prix, in the hands of Thierry Boutsen, in both of these races the car failed to finish after its turbocharger failed.
At the Hungarian Grand Prix team mate Christian Danner raced the A9 but retired after 7 laps with rear suspension failure.
Arrows finished the season in 10th place, with a single point, earned by Boutsen's team-mate Christian Danner in Austria while driving the A8.

Arrows A10

The Arrows A10 was a Formula One car which the Arrows team used to compete in the and Formula One seasons. The car was designed by Ross Brawn and was upgraded slightly in 1988 when it was dubbed the A10B.
1987.
As BMW announced to pull out officially at the end of , Arrows team boss Jackie Oliver brokered a deal with support from its primary sponsor, USF&G, to continue the use of the upright 4cyl BMW engines under the name of USF&G subsidiary "Megatron, Inc.", founded by long-time F1 aficionado John J. Schmidt, who coined the phrase ""Horse racing may have been the sport of kings, but auto racing is the sport of corporations"". The engines were serviced by the team's long time engine guru Heini Mader from Switzerland, the former mechanic of Jo Siffert.
For 1987 the engines were fitted with a FIA approved pop-off valve which was mandatory for all turbo engines in the season with turbo boost restricted to 4.0 bar (previously turbo boost was restricted only by what the engineers felt the engines could handle, though most, including the BMW M12, usually went no further than 5.6 Bar). Power from the engine, which always had the ability to handle high boost settings, was still estimated to be over for qualifying and around for races with the cars also restricted to just 195 litres of fuel per race. During the season the team continually experienced problems with the pop-off valve cutting in well below the 4.0 Bar limit in both qualifying and races. Without the resources and financial backing available to the likes of Ferrari or Honda, it would take Mader until the three quarters of the way through the season to solve the problem.
In 1987 the team improved from its 10th place in 1986 to finish in 7th place in 1987. Englishman Derek Warwick scored 3 points for the year with a 5th in the British Grand Prix, and 6th in Hungary, while his American team mate Eddie Cheever managed to score 8 points from a 4th in Belgium, 6th in Detroit and Portugal and another 4th in Mexico, in what was his comeback year after missing most of the season when racing Sportscars for Tom Walkinshaw Racing's Silk Cut Jaguar team. His only Formula One race in 1986 was in Detroit for the Haas Lola team.
The car scored 11 points for the season leaving them in 7th place in the Constructors' Championship.
1988.
The car, with upgrades to suspension and aerodynamics, was dubbed the A10B and was more successful in 1988 when most teams had converted to running 3.5L naturally aspirated engines in preparation for turbocharged engines being banned from . Arrows continued with the Megatron turbos and finished 5th in the 1988 Constructors' Championship and Eddie Cheever scored the A10's only podium finish with a 3rd placing at the 1988 Italian Grand Prix. Warwick also finished 4th in that race, only 0.582 seconds behind Cheever, in a great result for the team. Warwick finished 8th in the Drivers' Championship with 17 points while Cheever scored 6 points to finish 12th.
During 1988 Arrows were rated as a good chance to pick up points over the naturally aspirated cars due to having more power with the Megatron turbo, reported have around with the new 2.5 bar turbo limit (down in 1988 from 1987's 4.0 bar limit). The turbos were also restricted to just 150 litres of fuel per race in 1988, while the 'atmo' cars were limited only to what the car designers deemed necessary (the Benetton B188 allegedly had the largest fuel tank at 215 litres). Unfortunately for the team, the FIA mandated pop-off valve had a habit of cutting in well before the 2.5 bar limit, which restricted power and often left the cars with plenty of fuel to spare at the end of a race (the team had experienced exactly the same problem in 1987). Quite often the pop-off valve cut in at 2.3 bar or below in both qualifying and races (F1 engineers estimated that each 0.1 bar was worth approximately 20 bhp) leaving Warwick and Cheever with a hard time fighting off the atmos of Benetton, Williams and March, let alone challenging the other leading turbo teams: McLaren-Honda (who won 15 of the 16 races in 1988), Ferrari (who won the race that McLaren did not) and Lotus-Honda.
It took until just before the Italian Grand Prix for Heini Mader to get on top of the pop-off valve problem, which turned out to be the FIA unit being located too high above the engine, resulting in less power, a problem that Honda and Ferrari engineers had long since solved thanks to the resources available to them from their respective factories. By moving the valve closer to the engine, Mader had allowed Warwick and Cheever to finally exploit the raw power of the straight 4 turbo and to be much closer to the front than they had been all season. However, while the pop-off valve issue was finally fixed, the engine's other main problem that had remained since the 4-cylinder BMW had first appeared in F1 back in still remained, lack of throttle response from turbo lag followed by the power coming on like a light switch. This hampered the team in the final four races of the season, especially at the Spanish Grand Prix held at the tight Circuito de Jerez where the cars are constantly on and off the throttle over the course of a lap and good throttle response counts for more than outright top speed. Warwick could only qualify 17th at Jerez while Cheever started on the back row of the grid in 25th, his worst qualifying performance since .
In qualifying at Monza and with its Megatron engine finally exploiting the full 2.5 bar limit, Warwick and Cheever in the A10B were faster through the speed trap at , than the McLaren-Hondas which managed , though both Arrows and McLaren were slower on the straight than the Ferrari's. Despite this Cheever, who qualified the faster of the two drivers in 5th place (Warwick was 6th, only 0.155 slower), was still 1.686 seconds slower than pole man Ayrton Senna (McLaren).
During qualifying for the German Grand Prix at Hockenheim, Eddie Cheever, on a quick lap, had a close call at almost on the straight before the circuit's "Stadium" section. On a hot lap, Cheever moved to his left to pass the Eurobrun of Oscar Larrauri, while Ferrari's Gerhard Berger was on his own hot lap and was attempting to pass them both, the problem being Cheever had what was left of the road. Berger put two wheels on the grass which threw his car into a wild spin back across the track and directly between the Arrows and EuroBrun, just missing taking both cars and himself out in a high speed crash (luckily the Ferrari did not hit the armco and was able to drive away).

Arrows A11

The Arrows A11 was a Formula One car with which the Arrows team competed in the and Formula One seasons, and at the start of the season (badged as a Footwork).
Designed by Ross Brawn, the A11 was the first Arrows car following the ban on turbocharged engines at the end of , being fitted with a normally-aspirated 3.5-litre Ford Cosworth DFR V8 engine. It was raced to reasonably good effect by Derek Warwick and Eddie Cheever in 1989, Warwick finishing in the top six on five occasions and briefly challenging for victory in the Canadian Grand Prix, and Cheever finishing third in the United States Grand Prix, held in his home town of Phoenix, Arizona. With 13 points, Arrows placed seventh in the Constructors' Championship.
For 1990, the car received minor suspension upgrades and became the A11B, while Italian drivers Michele Alboreto and Alex Caffi replaced Warwick and Cheever. 1990 turned out to be far less successful than 1989, however, as the car failed to qualify seven times, and finished in the top six only once, when Caffi took fifth at an attritional race in Monaco. Caffi was also forced to sit out the United States and Spanish races through injury, Germany's Bernd Schneider deputising on both occasions. The two points from Monaco gave Arrows ninth in the Constructors' Championship.
By the start of 1991, the team had been taken over by the Japanese Footwork concern and renamed accordingly, and had also secured a deal to run Porsche V12 engines, replacing the Fords. However, the team's car for that season, the FA12, had to be redesigned when it was discovered that the large Porsche engine, the 3512, could not fit into it. The team therefore modified the A11B into the A11C to accommodate this engine, and used it in the first two races, as well as at San Marino after Alboreto destroyed his redesigned FA12 during practice. From these five attempts, the ageing car qualified only once (Alboreto in the United States), before being finally retired.

The FA13 chassis, designed by Alan Jenkins, was a conventional, straightforward car and Alboreto scored four times, 5th in both the Spanish and San Marino Grands Prix and 6th in both the Brazilian and Portuguese Grands Prix, the team finishing with six points and equal 7th with Ligier in the Constructors' Championship.

The Footwork FA14 was a Formula One car with which the Footwork team competed in part of the 1993 Formula One season. It replaced the FA13B, a revised version of the previous year's FA13 chassis that had been used for the first two races of that season. It was driven by veteran Derek Warwick, returning from a 3-year sabbatical, and Aguri Suzuki, retained from 1992.
At its first race, the attritional European GP at Donington Park, neither driver finished. The FA14's performance proved to be patchy; Suzuki managed a run of seven straight retirements towards the end of the season, while Warwick frequently finished outside the top ten. However, over the course of the season the car's performance steadily improved, with Warwick finishing sixth at his home race at Silverstone, and then fourth at the Hungaroring for his final F1 points. Suzuki's improvement throughout the season was even more marked; after qualifying on the back row at Donington, he qualified sixth at Spa ahead of Warwick and was running fifth until his gearbox retired, and finished seventh at the final race at Adelaide, although he and Warwick did collide at the first corner at Suzuka.
1993 proved to be both drivers' final full season in F1. Warwick retired at the end of the season, while Suzuki drove briefly for Jordan and Ligier in the following seasons. For the 1994 season they were replaced by Christian Fittipaldi and Gianni Morbidelli.

Walter Fellows

Walter Fellows (23 February 1834, Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire – 23 July 1901, Toorak, Melbourne) was an English amateur cricketer who later became a clergyman in Australia. He was the brother of Harvey Fellows, who also played first-class cricket.
Cricket player.
Walter Fellows was an all-rounder who was first noted as a schoolboy cricketer at Westminster School. In first-class cricket, he was mainly associated with Oxford University and Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). He played for several predominantly amateur teams including the Gentlemen in the Gentlemen v Players series. He had a reputation as a "terrific and very successful hitter". Fellows' name has appeared in the "records" section of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack for many years under the heading "Record Hit" with the same wording: "The Rev. W. Fellows, while at practice on the Christ Church ground at Oxford in 1856, drove a ball bowled by Charles Rogers 175 yards from hit to pitch." A note reproduced in an Australian newspaper in 1890 states that Fellows at the time was 5 feet 11 inches tall and weighed 17 stones 4 pounds.
Fellows made 24 known appearances in first-class matches from 1853 to 1857. He played in the University match for Oxford University against Cambridge University as a lower middle-order batsman and a bowler for four years from 1854 to 1857, making important batting contributions in 1854, 1856 and 1857 and having some limited success as a bowler in 1855 and 1856; he appeared in the Gentlemen v Players matches at Lord's from 1855 to 1857.
Later career.
Fellows became a clergyman and went to Australia, where he became the first vicar of St John's Church, Toorak. In Australia, he played for the Melbourne Cricket Club; a report in an Australian newspaper in 1878 indicates that Fellows was discouraged from playing in major matches by his bishop, Charles Perry, but that the retirement of Perry brought about a more permissive attitude from the new incumbent, James Moorhouse, and Fellows was able to resume.

Kashmir rug

A Kashmir rug is a hand-knotted oriental rug from Kashmir. Kashmir rugs or carpets have intricate designs that are primarily oriental, floral style in a range of colors, sizes and quality. 
This type of carpet weaving is not considered indigenous to Kashmir but thought to have been introduced from Persia. Most designs are distinctly Persian with some local variations.
Kashmir carpets are handmade, hand-knotted, and are primarily made in pure wool, pure silk and occasionally wool and silk blends. They are available in wide-ranging colors, designs and sizes. Akin to the famed Persian (Iranian origin) carpets, the Kashmir carpets and rugs are considered to be investments for life. 
Kashmir rugs are primarily made in Srinagar, Kashmir in north India although a significant part of the production also comes from rural Kashmir. Kashmir rugs carry a high premium in the world of handmade, hand-knotted rugs and are next only to the renowned Persian rugs. 
Kashmir rugs are made in a range of sizes like 3'x2', 4'x2'6", 5'x3', 6'x4', 7'x5', 10'x8', 12'x9' and 14'x10'. Due to the intensive labor involved, larger sizes are made only on a custom-order basis. 
Kashmir rugs are renowned to have bright, jewel-like color tones such as sapphire blue, ruby red, emerald green, aquamarine, amethyst, and ivory. Rugs from Kashmir are traditionally made in oriental, floral designs that typically involve the significant and culturally important motifs such as the paisley, chinar tree, (the oriental plane) and tree-of-life. Most of these designs are rooted in the Kashmiri way of living and are a symbolic representation of the age-old Kashmir tradition of hospitality, warmth and genuine love. 
It is often said in Kashmir folklore that a home is incomplete without a soul - a Kashmir carpet, which is said to "bring the entire house together" into a unified whole.

International Bowling Hall of Fame

The World Bowling Writers (WBW) International Bowling Hall of Fame was established in 1993 and is located in the International Bowling Museum and Hall of Fame, on the International Bowling Campus in Arlington, Texas.
History.
The International Bowling Museum and Hall of Fame was located at 11 Stadium Plaza, St. Louis, Missouri, USA, and shared the same building with the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum, until November 8, 2008. It moved to Arlington and reopened in early 2010.
Criteria for election.
WBW Hall of Famers are chosen strictly in the basis of athletic performance, to even qualify for consideration, a player must be an amateur and accumulate a minimum of 15 points in any combination of four specifically designated international competitions;
with gold medals occurring in an event other than five-person team. Five points are credited for a gold medal, three points for silver, and one for bronze.
Each summer, the WBW Administrator culls a database to determine eligible candidates and sends ballots with those players’ names and resumes to current officers of the World Bowling Writers, which formed the Hall’s Board. (Only medals won in the four Hall of Fame-designated competitions are listed in the players’ "vitae"; even if a candidate has won other competitions around the world, those titles are not on the recap sheet.)
Election process.
There are two categories: “Men” and “Women.” Voters can cast one vote in each category for every three names listed there, and one vote for any group of “leftovers” names in each category that totals less than three. The man and woman who receive the most votes are elected.
In the case of ties, more than one man or one woman can be elected, provided that each candidate in the tie receives at least two-thirds of the total votes cast in that category that year. If that standard is not met, no one is elected in that category that year.

Smoked glass

The term smoked glass refers to two different types of glass. It can be either of the following:
(1) Smoked glass is a flat sheet of glass held in the smoke of a candle flame (or other inefficiently burning hydrocarbon) such that one surface of the sheet of glass is covered in a layer of smoke residue. The glass is then used as a medium for recording pen traces in scientific instruments. The advantages of using the glass are that the recording medium is easily renewable (just re-smoke the glass), and that the trace obtained can easily be magnified by projection onto a suitable surface. A variation on this scheme is the use of smoked paper in early seismographs.
(2) Smoked glass is glass manufactured with darkening materials incorporated, such that light passing through the glass is decreased in brightness. It can be used aesthetically, for example, in the manufacture of coffee tables with smoked glass tops. It can also be used in scientific instruments as a filter, as in the use of smoked glass in cross-staves and sextants, allowing operators to make sun sightings without damaging their eyesight.

The Fountain (soundtrack)

The Fountain: Music from the Motion Picture is the soundtrack album to the 2006 film "The Fountain" directed by Darren Aronofsky. Released on November 27, 2006, through Nonesuch Records, the album is a collaboration between contemporary classical composer and frequent Aronofsky collaborator Clint Mansell, classical string quartet the Kronos Quartet, and post-rock band Mogwai. The score received positive reviews from critics and was nominated for several awards.
Recording.
Clint Mansell—the composer for Aronofsky's previous films "Pi" and "Requiem for a Dream"—reprised his role for "The Fountain". The San Francisco-based string quartet Kronos Quartet—who previously performed for the "Requiem for a Dream" soundtrack—and Scottish post-rock band Mogwai also contributed to the film score. Darren Aronofsky hoped that David Bowie—whose song "Space Oddity" helped influence the film's space traveler storyline—would record a song when the musical artist worked briefly with composer Clint Mansell during production. Aronofsky planned for Bowie to rework pieces of the score and to vocalize them, but the plan was unsuccessful. After the score was completed, Nonesuch Records, the home of "The Fountain" musical contributor Kronos Quartet, released the soundtrack on November 21, 2006.
Mansell researched possible scores to compose one tying together the three storylines. He sought to have an organic feeling to the score and explored implementing orchestral and electronic elements that would have "a real human element to them that breathes". Contrary to most films' scores composed in post-production, Mansell's score was composed concurrently with the film's production; he created a mood that flourished as the film progressed. The composer described the parallel process, "It's instinct and listening to what the film is telling you it needs".
Mansell drew from five to six years of writing material for "The Fountain". The composer planned for the score to be pure percussion when the film was first meant to be epic in scale. Mansell, lacking classical training, collaborated with an assistant in creating the score. They deconstructed the composer's initial pieces for "The Fountain" and re-played them in a key so the lead melodies could harmonically play with every progression. The song "Together We Will Live Forever" was an electronic piece designed by Mansell to be the protagonist's memory theme. Antony Hegarty, lead singer of Antony and the Johnsons, was commissioned to create a vocal piece over "Together We Will Live Forever" for the end credits, but the director decided that the vocals would not be appropriate to end the film. The song was ultimately performed by pianist Randy Kerber.
Marketing and reception.
The content and research agency Ramp Industry launched The Fountain Remixed, an official website driven by user-generated content. Users could download freely provided audio parts from "The Fountain"'s film score, remix the music, and upload the work onto the website to be evaluated by other users.
Mansell won the Chicago Film Critics Association's 2006 award for Best Original Score, and he also won the World Soundtrack Award for Best Original Soundtrack of the Year and Public Choice Award. He was also nominated for the 2006 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score for "The Fountain", but lost to Alexandre Desplat for "The Painted Veil". Mansell also lost a nomination for the 2006 BFCA Critics' Choice Award for Best Composer to Philip Glass for "The Illusionist".

Sultan of Pahang

Sultan of Pahang is the title of the constitutional head of Pahang, Malaysia. The current sultan is Ahmad Shah. He is the Head of the Islam in the state and the source of all titles, honours and dignities in the state.
History.
After the Srivijaya empire collapsed, around the 1000, Pahang was claimed first by Majapahit, Siam, and then by Sultanate of Malacca. Pahang was fought over by the Portuguese, the Dutch, Johor, and Aceh for most of the 16th century. During this time, its population was mostly killed or enslaved, its rulers murdered and its economy ruined.
After the decline of Aceh in the mid-17th century, Pahang came under the rule of Johor. However, Sultans of Pahang, descended from the Malacca and the Bendahara Johor royal dynasties, have ruled the state almost continuously from 1470, and gradually recovered a great degree of autonomy.
As the Johor Empire was falling apart with the loss of the Riau-Lingga territories, Temenggung Ibrahim of Johor understood this situation and quickly signed a treaty with Bendahara Tun Mutahir of Pahang in 1861. The treaty recognizes the territories of Johor (mainland), the Temenggung and his descendent's right to rule it, mutual protection and mutual recognitions of Pahang and Johor. With the signing of this treaty, the remnants of the Empire became 2 independent states, Johor and Pahang.
From 1858 to 1863, Pahang was fought over in a civil war between the two sons of the reigning Bendahara of Pahang. The war ended when Wan Ahmad was proclaimed the new sultan in 1887, but his role from that point onward was largely ceremonial, as the British forced him to sign a treaty bringing the country under control of a British Resident.

Lumino (band)

Lumino () is a hip-Hop group from Mongolia founded in 1996. Their music is dance-friendly and often melodic, with frequent contributions by external vocalists. Like most Mongolian bands, they like to include elements of traditional Mongolian music in their songs.
The creation of the band was inspired by a person named Jason who worked as an English teacher in Mongolia in 1996 and 1997. Besides giving language lessons, he also introduced his students to hip-Hop music. Five of them then came together to form Lumino, but a few years after the formation of the band two of their members, Chinzo and Hülgüü, stopped performing with the band. At one point Lumino consisted of more than a dozen members, headed by Skitzo, including the main MCs Skitzo, MC, Chinzo, and Lizard and MCs from the groups Old School and Skitzo's Free Style.
Around 1999 the group went through a major restructuring and changed their strategy in terms of songs they were producing. They also cut their members to five. Previously known for their hardcore rap, Lumino also started to make softer songs for mainstream audiences, and the head of the band was replaced by MC. A number of songs such as "Zam" and "Hüniih" were made into video clips and repeatedly played on TV, while the video for "Namaig dagaad tseng" was censored because of its too explicit imagery.

Kimberly Akimbo

Kimberly Akimbo is a play written in 2000 by Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright David Lindsay-Abaire. Its title character is a lonely teenage girl suffering from a disease a lot like progeria, that causes her to age four and a half times as fast as normal. Thus, Kimberly is trapped inside the frail physical body of an elderly woman. She meets another misfit (a teenage boy) and the two form an attachment to one another that borders on attraction. The situation is not helped by Kimberly's rapidly deteriorating health. Soon Kimberly's family gets mixed up in some crazy money schemes, and the family gets emotionally destroyed.
Plot.
The lights go up on Kimberly sitting and waiting for her father, who is late picking her up because of his drinking. He compensates by agreeing to take her to a burger joint for some food, where they meet Jeff, the nerdy kid behind the window, who asks if Kim can do an interview for his project. Buddy strongly refuses and drives away. The scene changes to Pattie, Kimberly's mom, talking to a sound recorder to her unborn child about her life and how she believes she's a 'good mother'. Later on, Kimberly calls Jeff and agrees to meet at the library later for the interview, as he is learning about progeria.

Lumpy Money

The Lumpy Money Project/Object is a compilation album by Frank Zappa. Released posthumously on January 23, 2009, it compiles the releases "Lumpy Gravy" and "We're Only in It for the Money" with previously unreleased material, with the overall package serving as an audio documentary of the production of the two albums, which share conceptual continuity themes.
Content.
The first disc consists of the 1967 version of "Lumpy Gravy", intended for release by Capitol Records (actually a few 4-track cartridge copies of the Capitol version were distributed to wholesalers and radio stations before MGM Records, Zappa's label at the time, forced Capitol to halt distribution of their version of the album), and the 1968 mono mix of "We're Only in It for the Money". The second disc consist of two remixes prepared by Zappa in 1984, with overdubs by drummer Chad Wackerman and bassist Arthur Barrow. The "Lumpy Gravy" remix derives from the 1968 edit; this third version of the album had not been released in full; an excerpt appeared in a sampler for "The Old Masters" box set. The second remix, of "We're Only in It for the Money" had previously been released on compact disc in 1986. The third disc consists of studio assembly material and interviews with Zappa discussing the albums, as well as the single version of "Lonely Little Girl".

The spikefishes are quite variable in form, with some species having tubular snouts (greatly elongated in "Halimochirurgus" and "Macrorhamphosodes"), and others have spoon-like teeth for scraping the scales off other fishes. Depending on the exact species involved, they reach a maximum length of about .

Jerold Hoffberger

Jerold Charles Hoffberger (April 7, 1919 - April 9, 1999) was an American businessman. He was president of the National Brewing Company from 1946 to 1973. He was also part-owner of the Baltimore Orioles of the American League from 1954 to 1965, and majority owner from 1965 to 1979.
Biography.
Hoffberger was a lifelong resident of Baltimore, Maryland. He was the only son of his father Samuel, a lawyer who was active in the Democratic Party and a major shareholder and board chairman of National Brewing. His grandfather Charles had been a local merchant who sold wood, coal and ice. Hoffberger attended the University of Virginia. During World War II, he served in the United States Army with the 1st Armored Division in Africa, France and Italy, where he was wounded near Lake Bracciano, northwest of Rome. Jerold Hoffberger was also involved in the Battle of Monte Cassino.
Business career.
The year after the war ended, he was appointed president of the brewery by his father after the death of his predecessor, Arthur Deute. Under the younger Hoffberger's command, National's sales rose from 230,000 barrels in 1946 to two million in 1966.
Baltimore Orioles.
In 1953, when the St. Louis Browns of baseball's American League wanted to move to Baltimore, the nearby Washington Senators, led by Clark Griffith, objected to the potential encroachment on their market. Hoffberger helped ease the way for the move by making his National Bohemian beer a Senators sponsor. When Browns owner Bill Veeck was all but forced to sell the team, Hoffberger and attorney Clarence Miles put together a syndicate that bought the team for $2.5 million and moved it to Baltimore as the Orioles. 
Hoffberger was the largest single shareholder in the Orioles, but was initially a silent partner with Miles (1954–1955), James Keelty (1955–1960) and Joe Iglehart (1960–1965). During this time, however, he bought more and more stock until he acquired controlling interest in 1965. He immediately brought in Frank Cashen, National's advertising director, as executive vice president. Under the direction of Cashen and general manager Harry Dalton, the Orioles won four AL pennants and two World Series from 1966-71.
He was a 1996 honoree into the Orioles Hall of Fame, inducted with Cal Ripken, Sr. and Billy Hunter. 400 showed up at the luncheon at the Sheraton Inner Harbor Hotel.
Later life.
National Brewing merged with Canadian brewer Carling in 1973. Hoffberger sold his share of the Orioles to Washington, D.C. lawyer Edward Bennett Williams in .
in the early 1970s, Hoffberger purchased a farm near Woodbine in Howard County, Maryland where he bred Thoroughbred horses for racing. While primarily a breeder, he did race horses on his own, notably winning the 1984 Razorback Handicap at Oaklawn Park Race Track.
Hoffberger died at Sinai Hospital in Baltimore.

NIST hash function competition

The NIST hash function competition was an open competition held by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to develop a new hash function called SHA-3 to complement the older SHA-1 and SHA-2. The competition was formally announced in the "Federal Register" on November 2, 2007. "NIST is initiating an effort to develop one or more additional hash algorithms through a public competition, similar to the development process for the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)." The competition ended on October 2, 2012 when the NIST announced that Keccak would be the new SHA-3 hash algorithm.
Process.
Submissions were due October 31, 2008 and the list of candidates accepted for the first round was published on December 9, 2008. NIST held a conference in late February 2009 where submitters presented their algorithms and NIST officials discussed criteria for narrowing down the field of candidates for Round 2. The list of 14 candidates accepted to Round 2 was published on July 24, 2009. Another conference was held on August 23–24, 2010 (after CRYPTO 2010) at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where the second-round candidates were discussed. The announcement of the final round candidates occurred on December 10, 2010. On October 2, 2012, the NIST announced its winner, choosing Keccak, created by Guido Bertoni, Joan Daemen and Gilles Van Assche of STMicroelectronics and Michaël Peeters of NXP.
Entrants.
This is an incomplete list of known submissions.
NIST selected 51 entries for round 1. 14 of them advanced to round 2, from which 5 finalists were selected.
Winner.
The winner was announced to be Keccak on October 2, 2012.
Finalists.
NIST selected five SHA-3 candidate algorithms to advance to the third (and final) round:
NIST noted some factors that figured into its selection as it announced the finalists:
NIST has released a report explaining its evaluation algorithm-by-algorithm.

The following hash function submissions were accepted for Round Two, but did not make it to the final round. As noted in the announcement of the finalists, "none of these candidates was clearly broken".
Did not pass to Round Two.
The following hash function submissions were accepted for Round One
but did not pass to Round Two. They have neither been conceded by the
submitters nor have had substantial cryptographic weaknesses. However, most of
them have some weaknesses in the design components, or performance issues.
Entrants with substantial weaknesses.
The following non-conceded Round One entrants have had substantial cryptographic weaknesses announced.
Conceded entrants.
The following Round One entrants have been officially retracted from the competition by their submitters; they are considered broken according to the NIST official Round One Candidates web site. As such, they are withdrawn from the competition.
Rejected entrants.
Several submissions received by NIST were not accepted as First Round Candidates, following an internal review by NIST. In general, NIST gave no details as to why each was rejected. NIST also has not given a comprehensive list of rejected algorithms; there are known to be 13, but only the following are public.

Barbados–Guyana relations

Barbados–Guyana relations refers to the current and historical relationship between Barbados and Guyana. The later maintains non-resident diplomatic representation from Bridgetown, while Guyana which prior had a High Commissioner to Barbados appointed its first resident Consul-General, Michael Brotherson to Bridgetown in January 2012.
General aspects.
The relations between Guyana and Barbados began while both were part of the British Empire. Shortly after Great Britain secured British Guiana (then British Guiana) from the Dutch, waves of migrants were encouraged to move and settle in Guyana. Barbados was one such location where large numbers of migrants came from. Through time Barbados and Guyana have both supported each other. With the move towards independence in the region Guyana was seen as the breadbasket of the wider Caribbean which lead to yet more waves of Barbadians seeking to move to Guyana for better opportunities.
In 1991 Barbados and Guyana attempted moves towards forming a tri-state confederation consisting of Barbados, Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago.
Later on relations became rocky due to immigration. Things became contentious for Guyanese persons to Barbados. The two nations continue their cooperation through the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and work towards building and maintaining good relations between their nationals. In 2012 the Consul-General of Guyana to Bridgetown noted that immigration matters between Guyana and Barbados had substantially improved with no complaints since being assigned to Bridgetown.[http://www.nationnews.com/articles/view/entry-ease-says-guyana-consul/
More recently the Guyanese Government has extended an offer to Barbadians. The Guyanese government has offered to put in place an economically favourable regime towards any Barbadians that wish to relocate to Guyana and contribute towards that nation's goals in agricultural investment. The announcement was made in the final days of the Owen Arthur administration by MP member Mia Motley.
In the early 1990s the Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago, Patrick Manning pitched an initiative for Barbados, Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago to enter into some form of political union or political association. This initiative was short lived and did not proceed following the Democratic Labour Party's defeat during the 1994 elections.
In 2004 both nations signed treaties to cooperate in the portion of overlapping international maritime boundary.

Balážová studied at the Academy of Muse Arts, Bratislava and Magister of Arts degree received in 1984. Balážová is also known as a teacher at the University of Trnava - since 1997. Husband - Blazej Balaz, slovak painter.
Immediately at the beginning, Mária Balážová, created her own „personal mythology“, emphasizing a snake motif in the geometrically stylised form of a cobra. This animal, which occupies an important position in world mythologies and religions, became the main motif of cycles of paintings, to which the artist gave the name Serpent Geometry. Balážová distinguished herself from classic Neo-Constructivism, outlined on subjectless combinations of shapes and colours, put together into geometric structures. Art theorists appreciate the „new significance“ she achieved by creating radically reductive forms (Jiří Valoch, 2002). "
Her works are held in the collections of Slovak National Gallery, Bratislava, National Gallery, Prague (CZ), Wannieck Gallery Brno (CZ), Jan Koniarek Gallery [http://www.gjk.sk/en/exhibition/], Trnava.
The artist has been a member of the revived Club of Concrete Artists 2 and the artist's group East of Eden. She lives and works in Trnava.

SM-68 Titan

The SM-68 Titan (individual variants later designated HGM-25 and LGM-25) was the designation for two American intercontinental ballistic missiles, which were members of the Titan family of rockets. These consisted of the Titan I and Titan II missiles, which were operational between 1962 and 1987, and were a major component of the United States fleet of missiles during the Cold War.
Titan was originally built as a backup to the SM-65 Atlas. The Titan I used RP-1 and liquid oxygen propellant, resulting in a response time of around fifteen minutes, required to fuel the rocket and raise it to a launch position. It was replaced by the more powerful Titan II, which used nitrogen tetroxide and hydrazine, allowing it to be stored with propellant loaded, giving it a much shorter response time.
Titan I.
The Titan I was the first version of the Titan family of rockets. It began as a backup ICBM project in case the Atlas was delayed. It was a two-stage rocket propelled by RP-1 and liquid oxygen. Using RP-1 and LOX meant that the Titan I did not have a quick launch sequence. It took about fifteen minutes to load LOX on the first missile at a complex, raise it topside and launch it, with the other two missiles following at about eight-minute intervals. Titan I was operational from early 1962 to mid-1965.
Several US Air Force units operated the Titan I:
Titan II.
Most Titan rockets were the Titan II, which could carry a W-53 nuclear warhead with a nine megaton yield, making it the most powerful ICBM on-standby in the US nuclear arsenal. These were deployed in three squadrons of 18 missiles each, in Arizona, Kansas, and Arkansas. All of the ICBM Titan II missile sites have been decommissioned since the retirement of the Titan II as an ICBM in 1987, but the Titan Missile Museum on Interstate 19 south of Tucson, Arizona, has preserved one deactivated launch site. The Titan II was a two-stage ICBM that was used by the US Air Force from the mid-1960s to the mid-1980s. The Titan II used a hypergolic combination of nitrogen tetroxide and hydrazine for propellant. In addition to its use as an ICBM, twelve Titan II missiles were converted to launch Gemini spacecraft for NASA, ten of which were manned. Following retirement, a further thirteen were converted to the "Titan 23G" configuration, and used to launch satellites, and the Clementine Lunar probe. The last Titan II launch occurred in 2003.

MEED

MEED, abbreviated from the former name "Middle East Economic Digest", is a 54-year-old business intelligence tool for the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), providing analysis and commentary on Middle Eastern markets, companies, people and data on the regional projects market.
Current business activities.
"MEED Magazine".
MEED publishes a business-to-business magazine for subscribers every Friday featuring news, analysis and commentary, features and interviews and a weekly special report. Circulation, according to a 2009 audit by ABC (Audit Bureau of Circulations UK), stands at 6,338.
MEED has forged a reputation for breaking Middle Eastern news since its 1957 launch. When the late Rafiq Hariri drew up plans to rebuild a war-shattered Lebanon, MEED met the prime minister and asked him to explain them. When Colonel Gaddafi unveiled the first part of his Great Manmade River, MEED took a front-row seat at the ceremony and quizzed the engineers. While US tanks were still rolling towards Baghdad in March 2003, MEED obtained plans from Washington that described how the US was hoping to rebuild the country. Three months before going public, MEED revealed DP World's IPO plans. Abdalla el-Badri announced Opec's potential move from US dollar to euro pricing to MEED. MEED broke news of Saudi Arabia moving ahead with plans for a Mile-High Tower in Jeddah – which would make it the tallest tower in the world – and Nakheel's plans to create a tower over one kilometre high (then called Nakheel Tower, later announced as Dubai's Harbour Tower) to trump Emaar's Burj Khalifa.
MEED is used as a source of Middle East information by the US and British governments – Energy Information Administration, United States Congress and the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office.
The dedication made by Abdullah II of Jordan in 2007 demonstrates MEED's positive contribution to the Middle East for over 50 years. "The celebration of this milestone is a testament to the distinguished insight into the region MEED has provided to its readers for five decades. Your acuity has recorded the region's diversity and potential, not just its challenges and crises."

Core sectors are oil and gas, petrochemicals, banking and finance, manufacturing, transport and logistics, power and water.
MEED Events.
MEED runs three summits – Arabian Hotel Investment Conference (AHIC), Arabian World Construction Summit (AWCS) and Arabian Power & Water Summit – and has more than 25 Middle East industry- and country-focused conferences in its portfolio, as well as networking clubs focusing on UAE and Qatar construction and power and water.
History.
The first issue of Middle East Economic Digest (MEED) was published on 8 March 1957. 
MEED's founder and driving force for the next two decades was Elizabeth Collard, a champion of Arab causes who was to become an adviser to UK Prime Minister Harold Wilson on Middle East affairs and a friend of Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt and King Hussein of Jordan. She also helped to establish the Council for the Advancement of Arab British Understanding (CAABU).
With two part-time secretarial assistants, MEED was produced on a hand-cranked Ronco printing machine. Every Friday evening, friends and relatives would help staple and stuff envelopes with the 12-page newsletter. Lacking any editorial resources, the Middle East Economic Digest was a compilation from newspapers and other reports. Newspapers were flown in weekly from Cairo and Beirut, translated and condensed.
By the time MEED was acquired by Emap in 1986 it had a staff of 20 full-time journalists and 12 researchers and newsroom assistants to cover Middle Eastern business and project news. 
In 2006 Emap Middle East also acquired business website AME Info. In December 2007, it was announced that Emap had agreed to sell its business-to-business titles including MEED to a consortium comprising private equity group Apax and the Guardian Media Group.

Redstone (rocket family)

The Redstone family of rockets consisted of a number of American ballistic missiles, sounding rockets and expendable launch vehicles operational during the 1950s and 60s. The first member of the family was the PGM-11 Redstone missile, from which all other members were derived. The first large U.S. rocket, modified Redstones launched America's first Earth satellite and first two astronauts.
PGM-11 Redstone.
First launched in 1953, the PGM-11 Redstone was a short-range surface-to-surface ballistic missile in active service with the U.S. Army from June 1958 to June 1964; and was used for the first U.S. live nuclear missile tests. It was built by Chrysler for the United States Army Ballistic Missile Agency (ABMA) and was deployed in West Germany.
Jupiter-A.
Jupiter-A was the first variant of Redstone, used to test components later used in the PGM-19 Jupiter medium-range ballistic missile.
Jupiter-C.
Jupiter-C was a sounding rocket used for three sub-orbital spaceflights in 1956 and 1957. It was used as a testbed for re-entry vehicles later deployed on the PGM-19 Jupiter.
Juno I.
Juno I was a derivative of the Jupiter-C, used to launch the first American satellite, Explorer 1, on January 31, 1958. Although the U.S. possibly could have put a satellite into orbit before the Soviet Union had the ABMA been allowed to attempt a satellite launch in August 1956, the Eisenhower administration wanted the first U.S. satellite to be launched by a civilian-developed rocket instead of a military missile derivative. 
The Vanguard rocket was being developed for this purpose, so the administration ordered ABMA's research director, Wernher von Braun, not to attempt any satellite launches. The Vanguard rocket failed on the first attempt to launch the Vanguard satellite in December 1957, crashing back to the pad and exploding. The administration then turned to the Army, and the ABMA and von Braun were asked to launch a backup satellite as soon as possible.
Mercury-Redstone.
The Mercury-Redstone Launch Vehicle (MRLV), also known as Mercury-Redstone, used the stretched Redstone configuration from the Jupiter-C for six suborbital launches for Project Mercury in 1960 and 61, including America's first two manned spaceflights:
Saturn.
Two members of the Saturn family of rockets, the Saturn I and IB, were derived from the Redstone. They used Redstone and Jupiter propellant tanks clustered together with eight Jupiter engines to form the first stage of the rockets. First developed by the ABMA, the Saturn rocket was adopted by NASA for its Apollo program. America's first heavy-lift launch vehicles, the first of these was launched in 1961.
Sparta.
Sparta was the name given to a series of surplus Redstone missiles with two solid-fuel upper stages launched as part of a joint US-UK research project with Australia from 1966–67. Sparta launched Australia's first Earth satellite, WRESAT.

Riototar

"Riototar" (also Riotutar, Reotutar, and Retutar) is an extremely rare Filipino surname used mainly in the island of Luzon, Philippines since the eighteenth (18th) century. Of the handful of the present-day Riototars (Reotutars), most reside in the city of Vigan and in the towns of Santa Catalina and San Vicente in the province of Ilocos Sur.
Historical origin.
On 12 June 1572, the Spaniards, under the command of Captain Juan de Salcedo, arrived in what is now the modern-day city of Vigan. At the time, Vigan was virtually an island, ‘detached’ from the Ilocos Mainland by the Abra, Mestizo and Govantes rivers, and their various tributaries and sub-tributaries.
One of the sub-tributaries of the Abra River was called ‘Rio Totar’, as per local oral tradition. Rio Totar is also used to describe the early settlement at the banks of the said tributary. However, the exact location of this ‘Rio Totar’ at present is not known, as the drastic changes in Abra River’s course over the centuries has caused the original course of the river to shift and most of its tributaries to vanish. Rio Totar is thus considered a lost toponym and cannot be found in modern-day maps.
However, local tradition places the location of the original Rio Totar to the North of the present-day Govantes River (which course has also changed). The barrios of Cabaroan, Pangada, and Cabuloan of Sta. Catalina town are situated in this fabled site. Incidentally, the aforementioned barrios have at present a fair number of inhabitants surnamed ‘Reotutar.’ 
On 21 November 1849, Governor General Narciso Clavería ordered a systematic distribution of family names for the native Filipinos to use. This was brought about mainly by the fact that Filipinos at that time did not use surnames or family names. Thus, the Catalogo Alfabetico de Apellidos was issued, containing at least 70,000 approved names to be assigned to families in all Philippine towns. Name distribution was systematic, in that every town was ‘assigned’ a particular letter in the alphabet, and all inhabitants thereof were compelled to adopt surnames beginning with that letter.
Santa Catalina town was assigned the letter “R”, hence the inhabitants thereof had to assume “R” surnames in the Catalogo, such as Ragasa, Rapisura, Rafanan, Real, and Refuerzo.
Some of the families living in the 'Rio Totar' settlement, however, wished to adopt “Rio Totar” or “Riototar” as their surnames. This posed a problem as “Riototar” was not listed as an acceptable surname in the Catalogo. The predicament was remedied when the people were allowed by the local government, through the intercession of the parish priest, to register under that name.
Variations.
Much to their chagrin, many ‘Riototars’ discovered that they were registered either as ‘Reotutar’ or ‘Riotutar’. The misspelling, which was brought about by the utter lack of systematized record-keeping at that time, remained uncorrected. Hence, most modern-day descendants of the original ‘Riototars’ are actually surnamed ‘Reotutar’ or ‘Riotutar’.
The confusion brought about by the introduction of the new lexicographic variants and the difficulty of spelling and pronouncing the surname, coupled by the migration of some ‘Riototars’ to other parts of the country, resulted in the many variations of the name that exist today. However, the surnames ‘Riotutar’, ‘Reotutar’, ‘Retutar’ and even ‘Retuta’, are still very much traceable to the original surname ‘Riototar’. All these surnames mean People of the Fabled Tributary of Rio Totar.

Christian Tychsen

Christian Tychsen (3 December 1910 — 28 July 1944) was an Obersturmbannführer (Lieutenant Colonel) in the Waffen SS who was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves (). The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross and its higher grade Oak Leaves was awarded to recognise extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership.
Early career.
Tychsen joined the SS in December 1931 with 50.SS-Standarte. He was later transferred to the SS/VT in October 1934 and served with the "Germania" Regiment as a platoon leader from October 1936 until December 1938 when he became the Commander of the 1st Company 'N' Battalion.
World War II.
When 'N' Battalion was dissolved he was moved to command the 1st Motorcycle Company.
In February 1941 his command was absorbed by the Motorcycle Battalion and was renamed the 3rd Company, although Schafraanek still kept command.
In January 1942 he was given the command of the Motorcycle Battalion. After being wounded in February, 1942 he was posted to the SS Officers school at Braunschweig until he had recovered.
In May 1942, he was given the command of II./Langemarck Regiment and retained in this position when it became the II./2nd Panzer Regiment in October 1942. In April 1943 he was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross.
Tychsen became 2nd SS Panzer Rgt commander on November 1943, and held command until he replaced the wounded Heinz Lammerding as temporary Commanding Officer of the "Das Reich Division".
Death.
After being wounded more than nine times in total, he was killed in Normandy (Operation Overlord) when the Kubelwagen, which he was in with a driver and an NCO, was fired upon by an advancing American tank. He died of his wounds in American captivity. Looters took his tunic with all his decorations and all other types of identification, so he was buried as an unknown soldier, but was later identified.

Davie v Magistrates of Edinburgh 1953

Davie v Magistrates of Edinburgh 1953 S.C. 34. encapsulates the Scots law position regarding the role of expert witnesses in providing their opinion to the court in criminal and civil proceedings.
Case.
In "Davie v Magistrates of Edinburgh", an expert witness, gave evidence concerning the effect of shock waves in blasting operations and referred to a specific section of a pamphlet that allegedly supported his opinion. The Court of Session disproved of the Lord Ordinary's action of adopting other parts of the pamphlet that the expert had not made reference to.
Law.
Lord President Cooper stated that "their duty is to furnish the judge or jury with the necessary scientific criteria for testing the accuracy of their conclusions, so as to enable the Judge or jury to form their own independent judgment by the application of these criteria to the facts proved in evidence." Therefore, an expert witness should only offer their opinion as to the facts that have already been established in court, and "should not hinder the trier of fact's duty by telling them how to assess the evidence that they have heard". The weight to be given to the evidence provided by the expert witness is a matter for the judge (in civil, or summary criminal proceedings) or jury (in solemn criminal proceedings) alone.
The court also stated that "expert witnesses are only required in order that certain facts can be assessed and understood in their specialist/scientific context".
Moreover, in this case it was held that "in some situations, the scientific knowledge that an expert witness claims to have must be proved in court", such as in "Hewat v Edinburgh Corporation" 1974 S.C. 30. This is to prevent false claims of credentials that may affect the reliability of the opinion advanced by the expert witness.
As a result of this case, only the extracts of any literature relied upon by an expert witness whilst giving their testimony may be used against them to challenge their opinion. The remainder of any texts/journals is not admissible and thus cannot be relied upon by the expert or any other party to the proceedings.

Cranbourne East railway station

Cranbourne East is a proposed railway station on the Cranbourne railway line in the south-eastern Melbourne suburb of Cranbourne East, Victoria, Australia. It would be the terminus of a short extension from the current Cranbourne terminus, with the station to be located west of Reynard Place and north of the Blue Hills retirement village, and adjacent to near the Casey Fields sporting complex. There is a proposed pedestrian underpass to be built along with the station.
The station was promised by the Australian Labor Party during the 1999 and 2002 state election campaigns, but was dumped in May 2006. In November 2003, a "Trainlink" bus service was introduced as an alternative, meeting each train at Cranbourne station and running on a largely one-way loop through Cranbourne East. The then state government's Victorian Transport Plan, released in December 2008, listed the station and associated rail extension as "medium term" project, which was estimated to cost $200 million.

Katipunan ng Kabataan

The Katipunan ng Kabataan (KK) which means Youth Federation in English, is the mainstream federation of Filipino youths duly sponsored by the government of the Republic of the Philippines. It has chapters in all the 41,996 barangays of the country.
Its chapter officers are elected at large by the members of the Katipunan ng Kabataan in each Barangay. The officers elected are known as the Sangguniang Kabataan, whose term of office is usually three years, although this has been extended in some cases.
The Katipunan ng Kabataan is not as popular as the Sangguniang Kabataan, although its members who are at least fifteen years old but not more than eighteen years based on the latest law, vote the officers that compose the Sangguniang Kabataan (Youth Council).
Katipunan ng Kabataan is an offshoot of the Kabataang Barangay in which former Representative Imee Romualdez Marcos, the presidential daughter of then late President Ferdinand Marcos (Liberal Party/ Philippines) became the KB President in 1975–1984.
Historical Highlights.
The Kabataang Barangay was created on April 15, 1975 by virtue of Presidential Decree 684. The decree provided for the organization of KB units in the 42,000 barangays all over the country with the purpose of giving the youth a definite role in community affairs and "ample opportunities to express their views that a complete cross-section of the will of the populace could be determined, thereby providing them a more democratic and popular basis for the legislation and/or other governmental operations."
The decree also provided KB membership to all Filipinos eighteen (18) years of age and below. However, under this Decree, only the 15-18 duly registered members of the barangay compose the KB assembly, which elects the KB Council composed of one (1) Chairman and six (6) councilmen. The Chairman automatically becomes an ex-officio member of the adult barangay and acts as the Chairman of the Barangay Committee on Sports and Recreation.
First National KB Elections
On May 1, 1975, the First National KB Elections was held. Elected were council members of 42,000 KB units and presidents of 1,482 Municipal KB Federations, 60 KB City Federations, 75 KB Provincial Federations, 13 Regional KB Presidents and one (1) National KB Federation.
First National KB Congress
On May 10-1, 1976, the 1st National KB Congress was held at the KB Training Center, Mt. Makiling, Los Baños, Laguna. It was during this Congress that the KB Constitution was initially drafted.
First KB Constitutional Convention
The KB Constitution was finally framed during the 1st-KB Constitutional Convention held on February 28, 1977 in Mt. Makiling, Los Baños, Laguna and was subsequently ratified by the mass members nationwide on July 28 that same year.
In the same forum, KB leaders agitated for the expansion of KB membership to include youth who are 21 years of age and below.
Presidential Decree 1102
In response to the wide clamor of KB leaders for the expansion of KB membership, Presidential Decree 1102 was passed on February 28, 1977 integrating all youth 21 years of age and below into the Kabataang Barangay.
Presidential Decree 1191
Presidential Decree 1191, promulgated on September 1, 1977 transferred the supervision of KB affairs from the Department of Local Governments and Community Development to the Office of the President. The decree also provided the organization with corporate powers and total autonomy in the management of its fiscal and operational affairs as well as the definition of its policies and program priorities. Thus, PD 1191 came to be known as the KB Autonomy Decree.
2nd Youth Congress
During the Second National Youth Congress held on September 6, 1978, the KB National Executive Committee (KBNEC) was formally organized. The Committee, composedo of the 13 Regional Federation Presidents, is the highest administrative and central implementing body of the PKKB. It is headed by a chairman. Said chairmanship is rotated among the members not more thatn once every quarter.
Second KB National Elections
The Second KB National Elections was held in April 1980 where a new set of KB federation officers at all levels was elected. Unlike their predecessors, the new municipal, city and provincial KB federation presidents now enjoy the privileges of Presidential Appointees as youth sector representatives to their respective Sanggunians.
KB National Reorganization
On March 6–20, 1982, a national reorganization was conducted. This move was initiated by the KBNEC to fully activate KB federations for the effective implementation of priority programs.
3rd National Youth Congress
The 3rd National Youth Congress was held on June 2–7, 1982 at the Hiyas ng Bulakan Convention Center, Malolos, Bulacan. It is in this forum that the KB members reaffirmed their commitment to the organization and outlined their political and development programs for the next five years.
In the same congress, amendments to the KB Constitution were proposed which were later on presented to the mass membership of the Kabataang Barangay for ratification through a National KB Plebiscite held on November 7–11, 1982. The ratification of the proposed amendments to the KB Constitution was officially proclaimed on February 4, 1983.
Batas Pambansa Blg. 337
Batas Pambansa Blg. 337, also known as the Local Government Code and approved by President Marcos on February 10, 1983, is the general law enacted by the Batasang Pambansa which guarantees and promotes autonomy of local governments. This is done through a system of decentralization giving local governments more responsibilities, powers and resources.
The Code also reinforces the government's recognition of the Kabataang Barangay as an effective, reliable and imperative partner in nation building, thus institutionalizing the KB movement.
The Code mandates that KB Officers be granted automatic representations to all Sangguniang levels up to the Batasang Pambansa. It also changed the term of Kabataang Barangay council officials from two (as provided earlier by PD 1191) to three years, unless sooner removed for cause or by resignation. Furthermore, it exempts them from tuition and matriculation fees during their incumbencies in any public secondary schools.
The Local Government Code also provides that ten percent (10%) of the total general fund of the barangay be appropriated to the local KB unit and that the KB Council can raise funds without securing permit from the Ministry of Local Government and Community Development.
'About Kabataang Barangay
The KB Symbol consists of the old Filipino scripts (K) and (B) representing the first letters of the Movement's name. The scripts are put together within a circle to form a logo akin to a face with open eyes and open mouth signifying a youth whose mind and intellect are keenly aware of social needs and is fearless in the expression of his beliefs. Red is the color of the KB Logo signifying strength of spirit and courage that springs from a historical tradition of heroic struggles for national freedom.
The KB Symbol denotes the ideal KB member - critical yet constructive in his socio-political involvements.

"Burn" was released digitally on 17 November 2008, as the second single from Mauboy's debut studio album, "Been Waiting". Musically, "Burn" is an R&B-dance track, that incorporates electronica influences. The song peaked at number one on the ARIA Singles Chart and became Mauboy's first number one single in Australia.

In 2009, "Burn" received an ARIA No. 1 Chart Award and won 'Single of the Year' at The Deadly Awards. It was also nominated for 'Highest Selling Single' at the ARIA Music Awards.
Background and composition.
"Burn" was written by Taj Jackson, Jonas Jeberg and Mich Hansen, and was produced by Jeberg and Cutfather. It was made available for digital purchase on 17 November 2008. A digital extended play with an additional track and two remixes of "Burn", was released on 24 November. "Burn" is an R&B-dance track, that incorporates electronica influences. Lyrically, it features Mauboy singing to a cheating lover, "Look what you did to me / I need a doctor, cos this is starting to burn!".
Reception.
Nick Bond of MTV Australia wrote that song is "worthy of Rihanna". Davey Boy of Sputnikmusic compared "Burn" to Mauboy's previous single "Running Back", writing it "is almost as good with its restrained use of electronica combining with a contagious chorus to result in a song which will be just as at home on radio as it is in the clubs." Dung Le of Mediasearch found "Burn" more "catchier" than "Running Back" and noted that its R&B grooves and catchy chorus will set "Jessica up well for a big assault in 2009 and a possible overseas release." "Burn" was awarded an ARIA No. 1 Chart Award for reaching number one on the ARIA Singles Chart. At the 2009 Deadly Awards, "Burn" won 'Single of the Year'. It was nominated for 'Highest Selling Single' at the 2009 ARIA Music Awards, but lost to "Running Back".
In February 2009, "Burn" was removed from most Melbourne contemporary hit radios playlists because of its title and the Victorian bushfires that occurred during the time. Mauboy's manager David Champion said that Mauboy understood and supported the decision, saying: "Jessica is very mindful of the terribly traumatic situation that is occurring in Victoria. She does not want in any way to add to people's distress." Program director of 91. 5 FM added that: "We have removed several songs from our line-up out of respect for the victims caught up in the tragedy. Even though these songs had nothing to do with the bushfires, they were a reflection of it."
Chart performance.
"Burn" debuted at number 30 on the ARIA Singles Chart on 1 December 2008. After climbing the chart for seven consecutive weeks, "Burn" peaked at number one on 19 January 2009, and became Mauboy's first number-one single in Australia. It was certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), for selling 70,000 copies.
Music video.
The music video for "Burn" was directed by Keir McFarlane and shot at the Sydney Botanical Gardens on 21 November 2008. The video begins with Mauboy sitting in the driver's seat of a red ferrari and then moves on to sing and dance in front of a bush. While singing the chorus of the song, Mauboy is seen outdoors with her backup dancers in front of a background of flames. The video then crosses over to club scenes where Mauboy is dancing alongside a bunch of people.

Anna von Schweidnitz

Anna of Schweidnitz (Świdnica) (also known as Anne or Anna of Świdnica, , , ) (Świdnica, 1339 – 11 July 1362 in Prague) was Queen of Bohemia, German Queen, and Empress of the Holy Roman Empire. She was the third wife of Emperor Charles IV.
Biography.
Anne was the daughter of Duke Henry II of Świdnica-Jawor from the Silesian branch of the Piast dynasty. Her mother was Katherine of Hungary, the daughter of Charles I of Hungary. In his autobiography written in Latin, which covers only his youth prior to getting married to Anna, emperor Charles mentions "civitatem Swidnitz" and "dux Swidnicensis", as depicted in the coat of arms room of his Wenzelschloss castle at Lauf an der Pegnitz near Nuremberg.
Anne's father died when she was four years old, and her childless uncle, Bolko II, Duke of Świdnica-Jawor became her guardian. She was brought up and educated by her mother at Visegrád in Hungary. At the age of 11, Anne had been promised to Wenceslaus, newborn son and successor to Charles IV. After the infant Wenceslaus and his mother Anna of the Palatinate died, the now-widowed Emperor asked to marry Anne himself. The planned marriage was part of the strategies devised by Charles and his then-deceased father John to gain control of the Piast Duchies of Silesia as "vedlejší země" ("neighboring countries") for the Kingdom of Bohemia. Anne's uncle, Louis of Hungary, the future King of Poland, was able to assist her by renouncing his rights to Świdnica in favor of the House of Luxemburg.
At the instigation of archbishop Arnošt of Pardubice, Pope Innocent VI issued a dispensation for the marriage, which was required because of the degree of relationship between the bride and groom (they were second cousins once removed through their common ancestors Rudolph I of Germany and Gertrude of Hohenburg). The two were married on 27 May 1353, when Anne was 14; her new husband was 37. The wedding was attended by Anne's guardian Bolko II of Świdnica, Duke Albert II of Austria, King Louis of Hungary, Margrave Louis of Brandenburg, Duke Rudolf of Saxony, an envoy of King Casimir III of Poland, and an envoy of the Republic of Venice.
On 28 July 1353, Anna was crowned Queen of Bohemia in Prague by Archbishop Arnošt of Pardubice. On 9 February 1354, in Aachen, she was crowned German queen. As part of the coronation of Charles as Holy Roman Emperor on 5 April 1355, in the Roman Basilica of Saint Peter, Anne was crowned Empress of the Holy Roman Empire. She was thereby the first Queen of Bohemia to become Empress.
In 1358, Anne bore a daughter, Elisabeth, who was named after Elisabeth of Bohemia (1292–1330). In February 1361 she became mother of the desired successor to the throne, Wenceslaus, who was born in Nuremberg, and baptized on 11 April in the Sebalduskirche by the Archbishops of Prague, Cologne, and Mainz. She did not live to see the coronation of the two-year old Wenceslaus, however. At the age of only 23 years, she died in childbirth on 11 July 1362. She is buried in St. Vitus Cathedral. The emperor married Elisabeth of Pomerania one year later. The Duchies of Świdnica and Jawor passed to Bohemia after Bolko's death in 1368.

The Cables

The Cables are a Jamaican rocksteady/reggae vocal trio led by Keble Drummond, who recorded for Studio One in the late 1960s.
History.
The group was led by Keble Drummond (sometimes spelled Keeble), whose first name led to the name of the group. Drummond explained "Now, I look at something with a cable and wires, and I say, well, 'Cables' would be a good name because you could send a message across the world, and that's how I came up with the name". He was backed by harmony singers Elbert Stewart (baritone) and Vince Stoddart (tenor). Drummond was taught the basics of guitar by Peter Austim of The Clarendonians and write his first songs after attending a songwriting course. Drummond had previously been a member of The Sylastians, along with Barry Llewellyn and Earl Morgan of The Heptones, and Clive Campbell of The Aces, and the Cables were first formed in 1962. After recording a single for Sonia Pottinger around 1966, they recorded a string of singles for Studio One, and these were later collected on the album "What Kind of World" in 1970. "What Kind of World" has been described as "a classic...a low-key showcase for some of the most under-rated vocals of the age". Studio One boss Clement "Coxsone" Dodd built up demand for the "Baby Why" single by limiting it to sound system plays for four months before releasing it. The rhythm tracks were later employed by Dodd on several tracks by other artists. Unsatisifed with the lack of money received from Dodd, The Cables recorded for Harry J while they were still under contract to Studio One, with Drummond altering his voice and the single released under the name "Herbie Carter" (a real singer who recorded for Harry J) to avoid Dodd finding out. By 1970, The Cables had left Studio One. "(Everybody) Feel Alright" was entererd into the Festival Song Contest in 1971, losing out to Eric Donaldson's "Cherry Oh Baby". They recorded a few more singles for producers such as J.J. Johnson, Harry J, and Bunny Lee ("Come On", recorded with Slim Smith), but failed to repeat their Studio One success. Drummond left the group to embark on an unsuccessful solo career in 1972, and briefly formed a new group, True Experience, with Trevor Shields and Bobby Ellis, releasing "My Girl" in 1974. 
"Baby Why" formed the basis of deejay tracks from both Dennis Alcapone and Prince Jazzbo, and the rhythm was used by The Gladiators for their 1974 track "Rearrange".
A second album, "Baby Why", produced by Harry J, was recorded in 1977, where they were backed by musicians from The In Crowd and Third World.
The Cables have reformed several times in the years that followed. Drummond earned a living working in a shoe factory during The Cables' peak and moved to the United States in 1979, later working for American Airlines.
A third album, also titles "Baby Why" and credited to "Cables and friends" was issued in 1993, and led to The Cables performing at the 1994 "Reggae Sunsplash" festival.
The three original members, along with tenor Owen “Bobby” Dockery, reunited in 2011 to perform at the Sierra Nevada World Music Festival in California.
Drummond released a solo album, "Mellow Moods of Music", in August 2013.

Barbados–Canada relations

Barbados-Canada relations are the relations between the countries of Canada and Barbados. In 1907, the Government of Canada opened a Trade Commissioner Service to the Caribbean region located in Bridgetown, Barbados. Following Barbadian independence from the United Kingdom in November 1966, the Canadian High Commission was established in Bridgetown, Barbados on 27 September 1973. There is a High Commission of Barbados in Ottawa and a Barbadian Consulate in Toronto. The relationship between both nations today partly falls under the larger gambit of Canada–Caribbean relations.
History.
The relationship between the nations of Barbados and Canada extends as far back as the late 17th century. During this period, Barbados and the current provinces of Canada were a series of colonial possessions of Great Britain and France. In the early most instances of trade between the two regions, Barbados and Canada found themselves able to fill niche markets between one another's markets. The Bluenose vessels were instrumental to trade as Barbados and other islands exported their sugar and rum to the area of Canada, in return Canada exported salted cod and lumber supplies to the West Indies. This trade continued for a number of years, however these ties eventually weaned as the influence of the Thirteen American colonies grew in importance for Canada, Barbados, and the wider West Indies region.
In 1907, the Government of Canada opened its Trade Commissioner Service to the Caribbean region. This was located on the current grounds of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Bridgetown, Barbados.
By the early 20th century several large Canadian financial institutions looked towards expansion into the West Indies. On 16 February 1911 the Royal Bank of Canada marked the opening of their first commercial branch in Barbados. then in 1920, CIBC did the same, and finally Scotiabank followed the first two in 1956.
Trade.
Today, the relations between both nations has flourished in recent years. A growing legion of Canadian businesses and companies have established operations offering services in Barbados. Additionally several reports have shown Barbados to be one of the largest recipients of Canadian Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). The Economy of Barbados on the other hand has witnessed Canada becoming its largest source of foreign investment. The governments of both nations continue to identify ways to cement good relations and to nurture economic growth between both countries.
During the Fifth Barbados Charity Ball held in Canada David Thompson, the Prime Minister of Barbados and also its Minister of Finance announced that Canadians represent some 75% of the international financial community in Barbados.
The Canadian government has also played an extremely critical role in the continuation of the Barbados-based Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) since its inception and acts as a significant lending country to the institution.
Politics.
Around the time of the various colonies of Canada entering into the agreement for confederation. The powerful Barbados Agricultural Society, (BAS) which was made up of influential Bajan plantation owners put together a proposition for Barbados to take part in this Canadian confederation as well. The proposal was made to Sir Francis Hincks, but the deal didn't proceed and Barbados' interest subsided. It was not until the 1950s, just prior to the country of Barbados negotiating independence from the United Kingdom, that yet another movement for establishing some form of political association with Canada was broached yet again. This time spurred by several Barbadian members of parliament.
In 2007, Canada's Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced the desire to heighten Canada's profile in the Americas. As part of his plan, Harper and his Canadian envoy visited several nations of Latin America and the Caribbean regions which included Barbados. Stephen Harper took part in several closed door meetings with the then Barbadian prime minister Owen Arthur and the other heads of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) group of nations. Since Harper's visit, Canada and Barbados have concluded a mutual open skies agreement and are currently in the process of working on a bilateral free trade agreement which will encompass Barbados and the rest of CARICOM.
The Canadian High Commission to Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean also spoke of the possibility of Barbadian and Canadian Companies forming joint ventures. At the time it was proposed that such an agreement could encompass infrastructure projects in the country of Barbados.
In addition to the Prime Minister's visit to Barbados, the Canadian Governor-General Michaëlle Jean also visited Barbados that same year where and met personally with the Governor-General of Barbados.
The overall relationship of Canada and Barbados are frequently overshadowed in media by the bilateral double taxation agreement between both nations.
In 2008, the three largest stock exchanges in the Caribbean (Jamaica, Barbados, and Trinidad and Tobago) mulled the possibility that the Caribbean Stock Exchanges might seek to associate in some way with the Toronto Stock Exchange. All three of these exchanges are currently seeking to join their three bourses into a more effective single Caribbean-wide unit known as the Caribbean Exchange Network (CXN)
In 2009 The Hon. Peter Kent, Minister of State of Foreign Affairs (Americas), saluted Barbados on achieving the country's 43rd anniversary of independence. In a press release the minister stated, "Canada salutes the people of Barbados as they mark their country's independence, Canada and Barbados have a long tradition of very close relations based on common values, people-to-people links and shared Commonwealth history."
Migration.
It is estimated that there are roughly 3,000–4,000 Canadian-born permanent residents living in Barbados and roughly the same number of Barbadian-born nationals living in Canada.
Tourism.
During the 1970s Canada became the largest source of tourists to Barbados. In 1979, roughly 97,000 Canadians visited the island of Barbados. Over time Barbados has seen market share from Canada shift towards lower cost Caribbean destinations such as Cuba or the Dominican Republic. Still yet many Canadians vacation in Barbados including past prime ministers. In 1965 one of Canada's former Prime Ministers, John Diefenbaker was saved by a would be future prime minister of Canada, John Turner after The Hon. Diefenbaker waded out too far in usually strong surf one morning. Something which surely could have altered the political landscape in Canada.
On Monday, 3 November 2008 WestJet commenced the airline's inaugural flight to Barbados. The main competitory of WestJet on this route is Air Canada. The airline announced the start of a four-flights per week schedule going from Toronto, Ontario to Barbados. During the post-inaugural flight ceremony held at the executive lounge of the Grantley Adams International Airport the Barbadian Minister of Tourism Richard Sealy said that the Barbados Tourism Authority was currently seeking to increase its tourism from Canada. He also offered opportunity to collaborate in the future with WestJet should they need a regional Caribbean hub. According to the Barbados Advocate newspaper Sealy stated "We are game if Westjet is interested, in becoming the regional hub for more of your business and we would certainly like to see not four flights a week, but eventually, if we can have a daily service. Grantley Adams is already an established hub and we can feed business into the other territories. So I think there are some possibilities for even greater levels of cooperation with Westjet" he remarked to his Canadian counterparts.
Diplomatic offices.
Both nations maintain direct high-level diplomatic representatives.

Jones v Lipman

Jones v Lipman 1 WLR 832 is a UK company law case concerning piercing the corporate veil. It exemplifies the principal case in which the veil will be lifted, that is, when a company is used as a "mere facade" concealing the "true facts", which essentially means it is formed to avoid a pre-existing obligation.
Facts.
Mr Lipman contracted to sell a house at 3 Fairlawn Avenue, Chiswick, Middlesex (now Ealing W4) to Mr Jones for £5,250. He changed his mind and refused to complete. To try and avoid a specific performance order, he conveyed it to a company formed for that purpose alone, which he alone owned and controlled.
Judgment.
Russell J ordered specific performance against Mr Lipman and the company.

Kačina

Kačina is a significant empire style palace in the central region of The Czech Republic. In 1945 it was designated a national property.
History.
Kačina was built in place of the defunct medieval village Kačín as a prestige mansion of the supreme burgrave of the Kingdom of Bohemia and president of governorate Jan Rudolf Chotek (1748–1824) from 1806 to 1824. The architectural scheme was drawn up by Saxon royal architect Christian Franz Schuricht (1753–1832) from Dresden. Johann Philipp Jöndl (1782–1870) and in the last few years also had controlled running the construction. He also eminently influenced the final appearance of the castle.
Functionally the castle is divided into three parts. The main (central) building with exquisite halls and the residence of earl family, then two quarter circle adjacent lower wings with pillared colonnade where the guest rooms were situated. To those wings were connected other pavilions. In the right one is situated never finished mansion chapel and theatre which were finished in the first half of 19th century. 
In the left one there is a Chotek's extensive library dated from 16th to 19th century.

Charles Pierre Claret de Fleurieu

Charles Pierre Claret, comte de Fleurieu (2 July 1738, Lyon – 18 August 1810) was a French explorer, hydrographer and politician. He was Minister of the Navy under Louis XVI, and a member of the Institut de France, as well as the brother of the botanist Marc Antoine Louis Claret de la Tourette.
Life.
Ancien Regime.
Fleurieu was born in Lyon. Engaged in the Toulon company of the Garde-marine from the age of 13 and a half on 31 October 1755, he subsequently took part in the campaigns of the Seven Years' War— which ended in 1763— participating in the battles of Mahon, Lagos, and Les Sablettes and rising to brigadier in the "gardes de la marine" company, and then "enseigne de vaisseau". In suggesting de Fleurieu's promotion to ensign, on 23 March 1762, the Minister wrote to the king :
On 1 July 1765 he was made Enseigne de port, and on 27 July he went to Paris to study horology with Ferdinand Berthoud.
He took part in a one-year sea campaign to test Berthoud's first marine chronometer, in an attempt to beat Britain in the race to find a reliable way to calculate longitude. The chronometers he thus refined with Ferdinand Berthoud for their later experiments were the object of major struggles with the king's horologer, Pierre Le Roy. Finally Claret de Fleurieu and Berthoud were entrusted with the task, setting out on the testing expedition from autumn 1768 to 11 October 1769 on the frigate "Isis" under Fleurieu's command. The chronometers almost invariably indicated the hour as accurately after the ship had left port, as if they were still on land. Knowing the actual local time at each present location by astronomy, they could easily determine the ship's exact position and longitude on a chart. The results of their observations was published in 1773 under the title "Voyage fait par ordre du roi, pour éprouver les horloges marines" ("Voyage made by order of the king, to test marine chronometers"). We can also cite among his major works "le Neptune du Nord" or "l'Atlas du Cattegat et de la Baltique", an atlas of the Kattegat and the Baltic Sea that took him 25 years.
Made "lieutenant de vaisseau" on 1 October 1773, then deputy inspector of naval charts and plans, he also became deputy inspector of the naval academy on 15 May 1776. He was presented to the king and named "capitaine de vaisseau" on 5 December 1776 and soon afterwards director of ports and arsenals in January 1777, a post heading the fleet's organization of matériel, works and movements created specially for him by Louis XVI and one he held for 15 years. In it he directed nearly all planning for naval operations in the 1778-83 war against England as part of France's involvement in the American Revolutionary War, as well as all the French voyages of discovery such as that of La Pérouse.
French Revolution.
The king made him "Ministre de la Marine et des Colonies" on 26 October 1790. He and the king wanted to separate the naval and colonial ministries, but the Assemblée nationale thought otherwise, and he resigned on 15 April 1791. Later that year he was made guardian of the Dauphin, later Louis XVII. He remained in the Tuileries on 10 August 1792, in support of Louis XVI right up until the critical point, but fortunately for him the revolutionaries did not discover this. In the midst of the Reign of Terror, in September 1793, Charles Pierre was arrested due to a letter of recommendation Louis XVI had sent to the Assemblée nationale, published in the "Universal Monitor" on 17 April 1791, in which he first demanded Charles' nomination as the Dauphin's governor. He remained imprisoned with his wife in the Madelonnettes for 14 months; they were finally released to find their homes, furniture, lands and resources dispersed and destroyed. A letter to the "section des piques" in the prison. discovered in Robespierre's house. speaks of a first arrest, which may suggest Charles was arrested several times and transferred from prison to prison. After the fall of Robespierre he was made a member of the Bureau des longitudes and of the Institut after M. de Bougainville's resignation in 1795. In 1797 (year V) he was elected deputy for the Seine in the Council of Ancients under the name Claret-Fleurieu. He remained so until the coup d'état of 18 Fructidor when he was excluded from the Council. He was elected a member of the Conseil d'État on 24 December 1799.
First French Empire.
On 30 September 1800, as Minister Plenipotentiary, he signed a treaty of friendship and commerce between France and the United States at Morfontaine, alongside Joseph Bonaparte. A member of the Council of State in 1800, he presided over its naval section and was interim Minister of the Navy several times during 1803 and 1804. He was named Quartermaster General of the emperor Napoleon's household and of the Imperial civil list on 10 July 1804.
On 24 July 1805 he was elected a member of the Sénat conservateur and made a Grand Officer of the Legion of Honor. On 1 August 1805, he was made Governor of the Tuilleries and the Louvre, taking the oath before the Emperor on 8 September that year. On 2 February 1806 he was elected one of the seven senators who composed the Council of Administration within the Senate for that year. In 1808 he was made Councilor of State for life and an Imperial Count. On 7 September of that same year, Napoleon put him in charge of the investigation into the French defeat at the Battle of Trafalgar.
He died in Paris from a devastating cerebral hemorrhage, a few seconds after embracing his two daughters. Napoleon rewarded his services by giving him a state funeral and having his remains transferred to the Panthéon.
Marriage and issue.
At 54 he married Aglaé-Françoise Deslacs d'Arcambal; they had one son who died young, Caroline (Madame de Saint-Ouen, from whom his descendants trace their line) and a second daughter.
Works.
He also edited the "Voyage autour du monde" which was written in 1790 and 1792 by Étienne Marchand, year VI (1798).

Human influenza hemagglutinin (HA) is a surface glycoprotein required for the infectivity of the human virus. The HA tag is derived from the HA-molecule corresponding to amino acids 98-106 has been extensively used as a general epitope tag in expression vectors. Many recombinant proteins have been engineered to express the HA tag, which does not appear to interfere with the bioactivity or the biodistribution of the recombinant protein. This tag facilitates the detection, isolation, and purification of the proteins.

Teochew string music

Teochew string music or Chaozhou xianshi ( also called "string-poem music") is classed as a type of "sizhu" music (chamber music for strings and woodwind, literally "silk/bamboo") although it typically uses stringed instruments only. It is found in northeastern Guangdong and parts of Fujian and also in regions with overseas Teochew populations, such as Singapore, Thailand, and the United States. The Chaoshan region of Guangdong, bordering on Fujian and comprising the cities of Chaozhou, Shantou and Jieyang, forms its own cultural sphere. Teahouses often accompany with Chaozhou music. 
History.
Developed from a fusion of elements, popular song, arias of Chinese opera, ancient melodies and pieces of Buddhist music, "string music" falls into two styles: "Rujia yue"（儒家乐） is music of the Confucian school that can be performed as an independent instrumental music genre or at weddings and other ceremonies and that aims at elegance and nobility, while "Pengding yue"（棚顶乐） is principally the music of the theatre, though it may be played independently: it cultivates a sober, rustic style.
Instruments.
The instruments most commonly employed include several varieties of two-stringed bowed lutes; the "zixian" (字弦) "erxian"（二弦） or "touxian" (头弦) the lead instrument in the Hakka style, shorter and higher-pitched than the "erxian"), the "tihu" (of lower pitch than the "zixian", adapted from the Cantonese "gaohu") and the big and small "yehu" (coconut shell body), as well as several types of plucked lutes: the "pipa", large and small "sanxian" (a fretless bass instrument like the "shamisen"), "qinqin" (four-stringed with short, fretted neck and round body), "ruan" (four-stringed with long, fretted neck and round body) and "meihuaqin". Other than this, the "zheng" (zither) and "yangqin" (a hammered dulcimer thought to derive from the Iranian santur) are played as well as percussion instruments: a hand-held wooden clapper ("muban"), a pair of "temple" blocks ("daban" and "fuban") that mark the beat, and a small drum ("zhegu"). Cello is sometimes also used, particularly in the style performed in the area of Shantou.
Characteristics.
The ten characteristic compositions of "xianshi yue" are 
The form of each of these pieces resembles a suite ("taoqu") of variations upon a stock melody ("qupai" or "noted tune"). These are called "ban" or "beat" variations and follow an ordered sequence with changes of tempo and measure (most pieces have six or eight beat measures). Augmentation and diminution of the melody is used, so that it may repeatedly double in speed through the variations. The technique of "cui" introduces a division-like filling in of the melody with figures such as repeated notes and neighbouring or passing notes. Perfect-fourth transposition of the melody ("fan") also occurs, though the tonal centre remains constant. 
Four or five main modes ("diao") are traditionally identified. However, while elsewhere in China such modes are mainly defined by absolute pitch and by the degree of the pentatonic scale that is taken as the key-note (thus setting the intervals of the scale), the xianshi conception of mode, rather like the Indian raga system, includes motif, ornament and intonation. Pitch is not absolute but the scale is usually constructed on a key-note approximating to western concert F - F#. Modes are pentatonic but all derive from a seven-note scale: no notice is taken of the starting and finishing tones of the melody in determining the mode and the key-note remains the same in every mode. Tunes may be adapted to a new mode, but the mode remains constant throughout any performance of the suite.
Apart from the major pentatonic scale two further tones, corresponding to a (sharp) perfect fourth and a (flat) major seventh, are employed. The "missing" steps of the scale in each mode may be used in ornament but are not part of main mode structure. The mode "qingsan qingliu" ("Light III Light VI") is the standard major pentatonic. But "qingsan zhongliu" ("Light III Heavy VI") calls for a heavy string-pressure upon the sixth degree, raising it to the seventh. "Zhongsan zhongliu" ("Heavy III Heavy VI"), similarly, applies this upward string-bend to the third degree as well, raising it to the fourth. The fourth common scale, called "Huowu" ("Live V"), resembles this last but avoids the plain third degree and instead uses a heavy vibrato on the second degree. This is said to be the most characteristic mode of the region.
Chaozhou drum music includes the big drum and gong, the small drum and gong, the dizi set drum and dong and su drum and gong ensembles. The current Chaozhou drum music is said to be similar to the form of the Drum and Wind Music of the Han and Tang Dynasties.

Picap

PICAP is a Catalan record label headquartered in Castellar del Vallès, Spain. It was founded in 1984.
History.
PICAP supports Catalonian authors and performers. While respecting the performer's linguistic expression, it gives preferential support to the Catalan language.
Its debuted as a record label in 1984 with four maxi-singles that appeared simultaneously: the technopop band Programa, Javier Asensi, pop group Oslo, and hard-rock artist Rockson.
Hector Vila, Maria-Josep Villarroya, Josep Tero, Gato Pérez, and Joan Soler Boronat were among PICAP's first artists. The first commercial success of the new record label was Catalan humorist Eugenio.
In the last years of the 1980s, the band Grec, a PICAP artist, joined in a wave of funk music similar to that of other new bands that were starting their careers in those days (such as Duble Buble and N'Gai N'Gai).
The band Sau, after the success achieved on PICAP with "Quina nit", signed for a multinational record label. The band Sangtraït, however, stayed with PICAP and prepared its fourth album "Contes i llegendes" at a time when Catalan rock had reached its peak. Rock and “Cançó” became PICAP's main genres with notable artists in both genres.
In 1991, Lluís Llach joined the record label because of its prestige and trustworthiness, then established ties with Companyia Elèctrica Dharma, Tomeu Penya, Raimon, Maria del Mar Bonet, and Marina Rossell. In 1993, the record company received National Music Awards in Catalonia for their releases. In the late 1990s, the Valencian band Al Tall published with PICAP.
The record company began reissuing CDs of historic Catalonian music recordings, including the catalog of Edigsa. Also included were LPs of artists like Iceberg, Pegasus, Xesco Boix, Group of Folk, Ara Va Bo, Sisa, and Música Dispersa. The recordings came from labels like Als Vents 4 or from the artists themselves, such as Max Sunyer or Santi Arisa.

The Great Brocade or Great Gray Dart ("Eurois occulta") is a moth of the family Noctuidae. It is found in Northern and Central Europe, Northern and Central Asia and the Northern parts of North America (coast to coast in Canada, south in east to Virginia and the Great Lakes States).
The wingspan is 50–60 mm. The moth flies from June to September depending on the location. There is one generation in North America.
It has been suggested, based partly on pupal remains in peat, that outbreaks of this species played a role in the collapse of Viking settlements in Greenland. These deposits at Anavik are now dried out and any potential evidence has been lost.
The larvae feed on "Myrica gale", "Vaccinium", Birch, Willow and other herbaceous plants.

Dividing the Estate

Dividing the Estate is a play by Horton Foote. Set in the fictional town of Harrison, Texas in 1987, it focuses on the Gordons, a clan of malcontents ruled by octogenarian matriarch Stella that must prepare for an uncertain future when plunging real estate values and an unexpected tax bill have a negative impact on the family fortune. Stella's children - predatory Mary Jo, complacent Lucille, and alcoholic Lewis - engage in a debate about whether or not they should divide the estate while their mother is still alive in order to ensure themselves financial independence.
The play premiered at the McCarter Theatre in New Jersey in 1989. Presented by the Lincoln Center Theater Company and Primary Stages Theater, it opened on September 27, 2007 at the off-Broadway 59East59Street Theatre, where it ran until October 27. Directed by Michael Wilson, the cast included Elizabeth Ashley as Stella, Hallie Foote as Mary Jo, Penny Fuller as Lucille, and Gerald McRaney as Lewis.
In his review in the "New York Times", Ben Brantley called the play "deeply funny" and stated, "Mr. Foote's authorial gaze is focused with satiric sharpness while retaining its elegiac sense of life's transience." David Rooney of "Variety" thought it was "distinctly old-fashioned . . . with an air of familiarity" but added, "Spend time with Foote's richly human characters and concerns about the play's dustiness quickly fade. The Chekhovian intrusion of past upon present, the melancholy acknowledgement of a world in decline, the gentle but tart humor, the clear-eyed compassion tinged with despair - these qualities remind us why the 91-year-old playwright remains such a distinctively expressive voice in contemporary American drama." 
Horton Foote won the Outer Critics Circle Award for Outstanding New Off-Broadway Play and the Obie Award for Playwriting. 
The production transferred to Broadway for a limited engagement with its original cast intact. It began previews at the Booth Theatre on October 23, 2008, officially opened on November 20, and closed on January 4, 2009.
Joe Dziemianowicz of the "New York Daily News" said the play "goes for laughs and succeeds, and at the same time comments on more sweeping notions of avarice, entitlement and carpetbagging karma. It's not as profound or ambitious as Broadway's other multigenerational melee, "", but Foote's fine play does go down easy." In "USA Today", Elysa Gardner observed, "The folks we meet in "Estate" . . . can be immensely irritating, but they're not, well, bad people — or, truth be told, terribly interesting ones."

Nafka minnah

Nafka minnah (Aramaic: נפקא מינה, lit. "emerges from it" ) is a Talmudic phrase used in analytical debates. It is often used in the phrase "Mai nafka minnah"? (מאי נפקא מינה), which asks, "What is the practical difference?"
Terminology.
The question "mai nafka minnah" is a way of testing the difference between two or more explanations for a given law, by investigating the different practical halachic rulings that would follow from each explanation. In other words, it means "so how do they differ in practice?"
It is contrasted with the question "be-mai peligei", which also means "how do they differ", but implies that the two views have the same practical consequences and that the difference is the intellectual process by which they are arrived at (for example, which Biblical verse is the relevant authority).
Example.
Examples of a "nafka minnah" abound, both in Jewish law as derived from the "Talmud", as well as in any situation that presents multiple rationales for a particular item.
To begin the "Shabbos" meals, "kiddush" is recited, followed by the eating of "challah". During "kiddush", the "challah" should be covered, which has led to a market for commercially available challah covers that are often beautifully decorated with embroidery or other designs. There are three reasons given for this practice:
Now that the custom to cover the "challah" has been established together with its three reasons, one could ask what the "nafka minnah" would be between the three reasons—how would a difference in practice occur as a result of one rationale being dominant over another? Each of the following bullets represents a distinct "nafka minnah":

<doc id="20052769" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20052769" title="Al-Karmil (newspaper)">
Al-Karmil (newspaper)

Al-Karmil () was a weekly Arabic-language newspaper founded toward the end of Ottoman imperial rule in Palestine. Named for Mount Carmel in the Haifa district, the first issue was published in December 1908, with the stated purpose of "opposing Zionist colonization".
The owner, editor and key writer for the newspaper was Najib Nassar, a Palestinian Christian and staunch anti-Zionist, whose editorials warning of the dangers posed by Zionism to the Palestinian people were often reprinted in other Syrian newspapers. Beginning in the 1920s, Najib's wife, Sadhij Nassar (c.1900 - c.1970), a granddaughter of the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, was also a key editor, administrator and journalist for the newspaper. Besides writing, she also translated articles from the foreign press, and was editor from 1941 to 1944, when the British Mandate authorities refused to grant her a permit.
After the demise of the Ottoman empire in the wake of World War I, "Al-Karmil" continued to be published during British Mandatory rule in Palestine well into the 1940s.
Editorial policies.
Anti-Zionism.
Writing of "Al-Karmil" and another early Palestinian newspaper, "Filastin", Rashid Khalidi characterizes them as "instrumental in shaping early Palestinian national consciousness and in stirring opposition to Zionism." Khalidi contends that almost immediately after the publication of its first issue in December 1908, "al-Karmil" "became the primary vehicle of an extensive campaign against Zionist settlement in Palestine."
Najib Nassar, owner, editor and journalist for the paper, not only printed news items and editorials concerning Zionism and its aims, but also re-published articles on Zionism from other Arabic newspapers based in Cairo, Beirut and Damascus, such as "al-Muqattam", "al-Ahram", "al-Mufid", "al-Ittihad al-'Uthmani", snf "al-Muqtabas", as well as from Istanbul-based "al-Hadara" and Jaffa-based "Filastin". Further, Nassar devoted detailed coverage to the activities and aims of Zionist organizations in Palestine and abroad. Between March and June 1911, "al-Karmil" published a sixteen-part series on "Zionism: Its history, objective, and importance" that was later released as a 65-page booklet. The material included condensed translations on Zionism from the Encyclopedia Judaica, and the booklet concluded by describing the efforts of Theodor Herzl on behalf of Zionism, calling for men like Herzl, "...who will forget their private interests in favor of the public good," to step forth from among the Palestinian population to oppose Zionism. Nassar's purpose was to incite public opinion against Zionism, whose aims and activities he viewed as a threat to the Arab character of Palestine, but he also focused on alerting the public to instances in which the ruling Ottoman and later British authorities were colluding with Zionists to facilitate Jewish land purchases.
At the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 Najib Nassar spoke out against Turkish entry into the conflict and was put on a wanted list. Accused of spying for the British against Ottoman Turkey and its German allies, he fled from his home in Haifa to Nazareth, and from there, wandered over the Galilee and the eastern bank of the River Jordan. He went on the run for three years, living with Bedouin goat herders in the hills of what is now the Israeli Galilee, West Bank and northern Jordan, narrowly escaping capture.
Women's rights.
In 1926, "al-Karmil" began publishing a "women's page" ("Safhat al-nisa") that was edited by Sadhij Nassar, Najib Nassar's wife, who also served as an editor and director of administration for the newspaper as a whole. Her journalistic contributions between 1926 and 1933 have been characterized as a kind of "one-woman press", wherein she commented on a wide range topics, including women's activities locally, regionally, and internationally. Encouraging women to raise their male and female children equally and to take up work to facilitate their economic independence, Sadhij Nassar also urged women to get involved in politics, while avoiding factionalism in favor of unity. For example, in the late 1920s, Nassar wrote, "You are responsible. Yes, you Palestinian Arab ladies, Muslim and Christian, you are responsible for the integrity of the nation ["watan"] and keeping Palestine Arab as it was until now. Every woman will spread the spirit of cooperation among the sons of the Arabs in the souls of her children." In 1930 Sadhij Nassar was a founding member and secretary of the Arab Women's Union in Haifa, which was one of the more militant branches of the women's movement during the British Mandate period.
Relationship with the ruling authorities in Palestine.
Ottoman rule.
In its early years, "al-Karmil"′s editorial line reflected a positive approach toward the ruling imperial authorities, the Turkish Committee of Union and Progress (CUP), but by 1911, like most other pan-Arabist thinkers, it switched to opposing the CUP because of its perceived bias in favor of Zionism. Among the contributing writers to "al-Karmil" were many who had participated in the Arab revolt of 1916, such as Druze intellectual Ali Nasir al-Din and educator and journalist Hamdi al-Husayni.
British Mandate rule.
In the late 1930s, Sadhij Nassar was described by the British authorities as "a menace to public security" and a "prominent agitator". Arrested in March 1939 by British police and held in administrative detention under the Defense Emergency Regulations in a women's prison in Bethlehem until February 1940, when she was detained because "she was actively engaged in subversive propaganda." After her release, she returned to editing "al-Karmil", serving as the editor between 1941 and 1944, when the newspaper was operating without a permit after the British authorities had refused to issue one. She continued her activities in the women's movement until 1948, when she became a refugee and wrote for various publications in London and in Damascus, where she tried to open a branch of the Arab Women's Union. She is believed to have died in Damascus during the 1970s.

A blind arcade is an arcade that is composed of a series of arches that has no actual openings and that is applied to the surface of a wall as a decorative element: i.e. the arches are not windows or openings but are part of the masonry face. It is designed as an ornamental architectural element, and has no load-bearing function. Whereas a blind arch is usually a single arch or a series of joined arches as a frieze (sometimes called Lombard bands), a blind arcade is composed of a series of arches that have well-defined columns.
Blind arcades are a common decorative features on the facades of Romanesque and Gothic buildings throughout Western Europe, and are also a common feature in Byzantine Orthodox churches in Eastern Europe, and in Armenian churches.
